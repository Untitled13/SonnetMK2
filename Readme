This project requires the Glasgow Haskell Platform, As well as the "System.Random" module. 
System.Random comes with the full version of GHC, so I recommend that.

You can aquire these at: https://www.haskell.org/platform/

In order for this project to run you must edit the file sonnet.hs
line 37 of sonnet.hs contains a Haskell comment writen with the opening and closing braces "{-" and "-}"
where that comment is write the directory where you have stored Robert_Frost_Proccessed.txt, Sonnet.txt, and Complete_Works.txt.

It should be writen as a string with quotes on either end, for example:
"/Users/Example_User/Example_Directory"

you can run this project with the following command in terminal(definitely) or powershell(maybe):
runhaskell sonnet.hs
