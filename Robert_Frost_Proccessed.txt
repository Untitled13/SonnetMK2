 the pasture im going out to clean the pasture spring ill only stop to rake the leaves away and wa t to watch the water clear i may i shant be gone longyou come too im going out to fetch the little calf thats standing by the mother its so young it totters when she licks it with her tongue i shant be gone longyou come too    a boys will   into my own one of my wishes is that those dark trees so old and finn they scarcely show the breeze were not as twere the merest mask of gloonl but stretched away unto the edge of doom i should not be withheld but that some day into their vastness i should steal away fearless of ever finding open land or highwey where the slow wheel pours the sand i do not see why i should eer turn back or those should not set forth upon my track to overtake me who should miss me here and long to know if still i held them dear they would not find me changed from him they knew only more sure of all i thought was true    ghost house i dwell in a lonely house i know that vanished many a summer ago and left no trace but the cellar walls and a cellar in which the dayhght falls and the purplestemmed wild raspberries grow oer ruined fences the grapevines shield the woods come back to the mowing field the orchard tree has grown one copse of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops the footpath down to the well is healed i dwell with a strangely aching heart in that vanished abode there far apart on that disused and forgotten road that has no dustbath now for the toad night comes the black bats tumble and dart the whippoorwill is coming to shout and hush and cluck and flutter about i hear him begin far enough away full many a time to say his say before he arrives to say it out it is under the small dim summer star r know not who these mute folk are who share the unlit place with me those stones out under the lowlimbed tree doubtless bear names that the mosses nlar    they are tireless folk but slow and sad though two closekeeping are lass and lad with none among them that ever sings and yet in view of how many things as sweet companions as might be had    my november guest my sorrow when shes here with me thinks these dark days of autumn rain are beautiful as days can be she loves the bare the withered tree she walks the sodden pasture lane her pleasure will not let me stay she talks and i am fain to list shels glad the birds are gone away shes glad her simple worsted gray is silver now with clinging mist the desolate deserted trees the faded earth the heavy sky the beauties she so truly sees she thinks i have no eye for these and vexes me for reason why not yesterday i learned to know the love of bare november days before the coming of the snow but it were vain to tell her so and they are better for her praise j   love and a question a stranger came to the door at eve and he spoke the bridegroom fair he bore a greenwhite stick in his hand and for all burden care he asked with the eyes more than the lips for a shelter for the night and he turned and looked at the road afar without a window light the bridegroom came forth into the porch with let us look at the sky and question what of the night to be stranger you and i the woodbine leaves littered the yard the woodbine berries were blue autumn yes winter was in the wind stranger i wish i knew within the bride in the dusk alone bent over the open fire her face rosered with the glowing coal and the thought of the hearts desire the bridegroom looked at the weary road yet saw but her within and wished her heart in a case of gold and pinned with a silver pin the bridegroom thought it little to give a dole of bread a purse a heartfelt prayer for the poor of god or for the rich a curse    but whether or not a man was asked to mar the love of two by harboring woe in the bridal house the bridegroom wished he knew    a late walk when i go up through the mowing field the headless aftermath smoothlaid like thatch with the heavy dew half closes the garden path and when i come to the garden ground the whir of sober birds up from the tangle of withered weeds is sadder than any words a tree beside the wall stands bare but a leaf that lingered brown disturbed i doubt not by my thought comes softly rattling down i end not far from my going forth by piclang the faded blue of the last remaining aster flower to carry again to you rl   stars how countlessly they congregate oer our tumultuous snow which flows in shapes as tall as trees when wintry winds do blow as if with keenness for our fate our faltering few steps on to white rest and a place of rest invisible at dawn and yet with neither love nor hate those stars like some snowwhite mmervas snowwhite marble eyes without the gift of sight    storm fear when the wind works against us in the dark and pelts with snow the lower chamber window on the east and whispers with a sort of snhed bark the beast ccome outl come outl it costs no inward struggle not to go ah nol i count our strength two and a child those of us not asleep subdued to mark how the cold creeps as the fire dies at length how drifts are piled dooryard and road ungraded till even the comforting barn grows far away and my heart owns a doubt whether tis in us to arise with day and save ourselves unaided    wind and window flower lovers forget your love and hst to the love of these she a window flower and he a wmter breeze when the frosty window veil was melted down at noon and the caged yellow bird hung over her in tune he marked her through the pane he could not help but mark and only passed her by to come again at dark he was a winter wind concerned with ice and snow dead weeds and unmated birds and little of love could know but he sighed upon the sill he gave the sash a shake as witness all within who lay that night awake perchance he half prevailed to win her for the flight from the firelit lookingglass and warm stovewindow light j   but the hower leaned aside and thought of aught to say and mormng found the breeze a hundred miles away    to the thawing wind come with rain  loud southwester bring the singer bring the nester give the buried hower a dream make the settled snowbank steam find the brown beneath the white but whateer you do tonight bathe my window make it how melt it as the ice will go melt the glass and leave the sticks like a hermits crucifix burst into my narrow stall swmg the picture on the wall run the rattling pages oer scatter poems on the hoar turn the poet out of door    a prayer in spring oh give us pleasure in the flowers today and give us not to think so far away as the uncertain harvest keep us here all simply in the springing of the year oh give us pleasure in the orchard white like nothing else by day like ghosts by night and make us happy in the happy bees the swarm dilating round the perfect trees and make us happy in the darting bird that suddenly above the bees is heard the meteor that thrusts in with needle bill and off a blossom in mid air stands still for this is love and nothing else is love the which it is reserved for god above to sanctify to what far ends he will but which it only needs that we fulfill    flowerga thering i left you in the morning and in the morning glow you walked a way beside me to make me sad to go do you know me in the gloaming gaunt and dusty gray with roaming are you dumb because you know me not or dumb because you know all for me and not a question for the faded flowers gay that could take me from beside you for the ages of a day they are yours and be the measure of their worth for you to treasure the measure of the little while that ive been long away    rose pogonias a saturated meadow sunshaped and jewelsmall a crrcle scarcely wider than the trees around were tall where winds were quite excluded and the air was stilling sweet with the breath of many howers a temple of the heat there we bowed us in the burning as the suns right worship is to pick where none could miss them a thousand orchises for though the grass was scattered yet every second spear seemed tipped with wings of color that tinged the atmosphere we raised a simple prayer befure we left the spot that in the general mowing that place might be forgot or if not all so favored obtain such grace of hours that none should mow the grass there while so confused with flowers    w aiting afield at dusk what things for dream there are when specterlike moving along tall haycocks lightly piled i enter alone upon the stubble field from which the laborers voices late have died and in the antiphony of afterglow and rising full moon sit me down upon the full moons side of the first haycock and lose myself amid so many alike i dream upon the opposing lights of the hour preventing shadow until the moon prevail i dream upon the nighthawks peopling heaven each circling each with vague unearthly cry or plunging headlong with fierce twang afar and on the bats mute antics who would seem dimly to have made out my secret place only to lose it when he pirouettes and seek it endlessly with purblind haste on the last swallows sweep and on the rasp in the abyss of odor and rustle at my back that silenced by my advent finds once more after an interval his instrument and tries oncetwiceand thrice if i be there and on the worn book of oldgolden song i brought not here to read it seems but bold and freshen in this air of withering sweetness but on the memory of one absent most for whom these lines when they shall greet her eye    in a vale when i was young we dwelt in a vale by a misty fen that rang all night and thus it was the maidens pale i knew so well whose gannents trail across the reeds to a window light the fen had every kind of bloom and for every kind there was a face and a voice that has sounded in my room across the sill from the outer gloom each came singly unto her place but all came every night with the mist and often they brought so much to say of things of moment to which they wist one so lonely was fain to list that the stars were almost faded away before the last went heavy with dew back to the place from which she came where the bird was before it flew where the flower was before it grew where bird and hower were one and the same and thus it is i know so well why the flower has odor the bird has song you have only to ask me and i can tell no not vainly there did i dwell nor vainly listen all the night long    a dream pang  had withdrawn in forest and my song was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway and to the forest edge you came one day this was my dream and looked and pondered long but did not enter though the wish was strong you shook your pensive head as who should say i dare nottoo far i l l his footsteps stray he must seek me would he undo the wrong not far but near  stood and saw it all behind low boughs the trees let down outside and the sweet pang it cost me not to call and tell you that  saw does still abide but tis not true that thus i dwelt aloof for the wood wakes and you are here for proof    in neglect they leave us so to the way we took as two in whom they were proved mistaken that we sit sometimes in the wayside nook with mischievous vagrant seraphlc look and try if we cannot feel forsaken    the vantage point if tired of trees i seek again manland well i know where to hie mein the dawn to a slope where the cattle keep the lawn there amid lolling juniper reclined myself unseen i see in white defined far off the homes of men and farther still the graves of men on an opposing hill living or dead whichever are to mind and if by noon i have too much of these i have but to turn on my arm and  the sunburned hillside sets my face aglow my breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze i smell the earth i smell the bruised plant i look mto the crater of the ant    mowing there was never a sound beside the wood but one and that was my long scythe whispering to the ground what was it it whispered i knew not well myself perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun somethmg perhaps about the lack of sound and that was why it whispered and did not speak it was no dream of the gift of idle hours or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows not without feeblepointed spikes of flowers pale orchises and scared a bright green snake the fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make    i going for water the well was dry beside the door and so we went with pail and can across the fields behind the house to seek the brook if sbll it ran not loth to have excuse to go because the autumn eve was fair though chill because the fields were ours and by the brook our woods were there we ran as if to meet the moon that slowly dawned behind the trees the barren boughs without the leaves without the birds without the breeze but once within the wood we paused like gnomes that hid us from the moon ready to run to hiding new with laughter when she found us soon each laid on other a staying hand to hsten ere we dared to look and in the hush we joined to make we heard we knew we heard the brook a note as from a single place a slender tinkling fall that made now drops that hoated on the pool like pearls and now a silver blade    revel a tion we make ourselves a place apart behind light words that tease and flout but oh the agitated heart till someone really find us out tis pity if the case require or so we say that in the end we speak the literal to inspire the understanding of a fnend but so with all from babes that play at hideandseek to god afar so all who hide too well away must speak and tell us where they are    the trial by existence even the bravest that are slain shall not dissemble their surprise on wakmg to find valor reign even as on earth in paradise and where they sought without the sword wide fields of asphodel foreer tofind that the utmost reward of daring should be still to dare the light of heaven falls whole and white and is not shattered into dyes the light forever is morning light the hills are verdured pasturewise the angel hosts with freshness go and seek with laughter what to brave and binding all is the hushed snow ot the fardistant breaking wave and from a clifftop is proclaimed the gathering of the souls for birth the trial by existence named the obscuration upon earth and the slant spirits trooping by in streams and cross and counterstreams can but give ear to that sweet cry for its suggestion of what dreamsl and the more loitering are turned to view once more the sacrifice of those who for some good discerned will gladly give up paradise    and a white shimmering concourse rolls toward the throne to witness there the speeding of devoted souls which god makes his especial care and none are taken but who will having first heard the life read out that opens earthward good and ill beyond the shadow of a doubt and very beautifully god limns and tenderly lifes little dream but naught extenuates or dims setting the thing that is supreme nor is there wanting in the press some spirit to stand simply forth heroic in its nakedness against the uttermost of earth the tale of earths unhonored things sounds nobler there than neath the sun and the mind whirls and the heart sings and a shout greets the daring one but always god speaks at the end one thought in agony of strife the bravest would have by for friend the memory that he chose the life but the pure fate to which you go admits no memory of choice or the woe were not earthly woe to which you give the assenting voice and so the choice must be again but the last choice is still the same    and the awe passes wonder then and a hush falls for all acclaim and god has taken a hower of gold and broken it and used therefrom the mysbc link to bind and hold spirit to matter till death come tis of the essence of life here though we choose greatly still to lack the lastmg memory at all clear that life has for us on the wrack nothing but what we somehow chose thus are we wholly stripped of pride in the pain that has but one close bearing it crushed and mystified    the tuft of flowers i went to turn the grass once after one who mowed it in the dew before the sun the dew was gone that made his blade so keen before i came to view the leveled scene i looked for him behind an isle of trees i hstened for his whetstone on the breeze but he had gone his way the grass all mown and i must be as he had beenalone cas all must be i sald within my heart whether they work together or apart but as i said it swift there passed me by on noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly seeking with memories grown dim oer night some restmg flower of yesterdays delight and once i marked his fhght go round and round as where some flower lay withering on the ground and then he flew as far as eye could see and then on tremulous wing came back to me i thought of questions that have no reply and would have turned to toss the grass to dry    but he turned first and led my eye to look at a tajl tuft of flowers beside a brook a leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared the mower in the dew had loved them thus by leaving them to flourish not for us nor yel to draw one thought of ours to him but from sheer morning gladness at the brim the butterfly and i had lit upon nevertheless a message from the dawn that made me hear the wakening birds around and hear his long scythe whispering to the ground and feel a spirit kindred to my own so that henceforth i worked no more alone but glad with him i worked as with his aid and weary sought at noon with him the shade and dreaming as it were held brotherly speech with one whose thought i had not hoped to reach cmen work together i told him from the heart whether they work together or apart    pan with us pan came out of the woods one day his skin and his hair and his eyes were gray the gray of the moss of walls were they and stood in the sun and looked lus fill at wooded valley and wooded hill he stood in the zephyr pipes in hand on a height of naked pasture land in all the country he did command he saw no smoke and he saw no roof that was well and he stamped a hoof his heart knew peace for none came here to this lean feeding save once a year someone to salt the halfwild steer or homespun children with clicking pails who see so little they tell no tales he tossed his pipes too hard to teach a newworld song far out of reaeh for a sylvan sign that the blue jais screech and the whimper of hawks beside the sun were music enough for him for one times wpre changed from what they were such pipes kept less of power to stir the fruited bough of the juniper and the fragile bluets clustered there than the merest aimless breath of air j   they were pipes of pagan mirth and the world had found new tenns of worth he laid him down on the sunburned ealth and raveled a flower and looked away play playwhat should he olay    the demiurges laugh it was far in the sameness of the wood i was running with joy on the demons trail though i knew what i hunted was no true god it was just as the hght was beginning to fail that i suddenly heardall i needed to hear it has lasted me many and many a year the sound was behind me instead of before a sleepy sound but mocking half as of one who utterly couldnt care the demon arose from his wallow to laugh brushing the dirt from his eye as he went and well i mew what the demon meant i shall not forget how his laugh rang out i felt as a fool to have been so caught and checked my steps to make pretense it was something among the leaves i sought though doubtful whether he stayed to see thereafter i sat me against a tree j   now close the windows now close the windows and hush all the fields if the trees must let them silently toss no bird is singing now and if there is be it my loss it will be long ere the marshes resume it will be long ere the earliest bird so close the windows and not hear the wind but see all windstilled    in hardwood groves the same leaves over and over again they fall from giving shade above to make one texture of faded brown and fit the earth like a leather glove before the leaves can mount again to fill the trees with

nor is it sad to theel save only me there is none left to mourn thee in the fields the gray grass is scarce dappled with the snow its two banks have not shut upon the river but it is long ago it seems forever since first i saw thee glance with all thy dazzling other ones in airy dalliance precipitate in love tossed tangled whirled and whirled above like a limp roswreath in a fairy dance when that was the soft mist of my regret hung not on all the land and i was glad for thee and glad for me i wist thou didst not know who tottered wandering on high that fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind with those great careless wings nor yet did i and there were other things it seemed god let thee flutter from his gentle clasp    then fearful he had let thee win too far beyond him to be gathered in snatched thee oereager with ungentle grasp ahj i remember me how once conspiracy was rife against my life the languor of it and the dreaming fond surging the grasses dizzied me of thought the breeze three odors brought and a gemhower waved in a wandr then when i was distraught and could not speak sidelong full on my cheek what should that reckless zephyr fling but the wild touch of thy dyedusty wingl i found that wing broken today for thou art dead i said and the strange birds say i found it with the withered leaves under the eaves j   reluct ance out through the fields and the woods and over the walls i have wended r have climbed the hills of view and looked at the world and descended i have come by the highway home and  it is ended the leaves are all dead on the ground save those that the oak is keeping to ravel them one by one and let them go scraping and creepmg out over the crusted snow when others are sleeping and the dead leaves lie huddled and snll no longer blown hither and thither the last lone aster is gone the flowers of the witchhazel wither the heart is still aching to seek but the feet question whither ah when to the heart of man was it ever less

wall that sends the frozengroundswell under it and spills the upper boulders in the sun and makes gaps even two can pass abreast the work of hunters is another thing i have come after them and made repair where they have left not one stone on a stone but they would have the rabbit out of hiding to please the yelping dogs the gaps i mean no one has seen them made or heard them made but at spring mendingtime we nnd them there i let my neighbor know beyond the hill and on a day we meet to walk the ime and set the wall between us once again we keep the wall between us as we go to each the boulders that have fallen to each and some are loaves and some so nearly balls we have to use a spell to make them balance stay where you are until our backs are turnedl we wear our fingers rough with handling them oh just another kind of outdoor game one on a side it omes to httle more there where it is we do not need the wall he is all pine and i am apple orchard my apple trees will never get across and eat the cones under his pines i tell him he only says good fences make good neighbors spring is the mischief in me and i wonder if i could put a notion in his head why do they make good neighbors isnt it where there are cows but here there are no cows    before i built a wall rd ask to know what i was walling in or walling out and to whom i was like to give offense something there is that doesnt love a wall that wants it down i could say elves to rum but its not elves exactly and id rather he said it for himself i see him there bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top in each hand like an oldstone savage anned he moves in darkness as it seems to me not of woods only and the shade of trees he will not go behind his fathers saying and he likes having thought ot it so well he says again good fences make good neighbors j   the death of the hired man mary sat musing on the lampflame at the table waiting for warren when she heard his step she ran on tiptoe down the darkened passage to meet him in the doorway with the news and put him on his guard csilas is back she pushed him outward with her through the door and shut it after her be kind she said she took the market things from warrens arms and set them on the porch then drew him down to sit beside her on the wooden steps when was i ever anything but kind to him but ill not have the fellow back he said i told him so last haying didnt i if he left then i said that ended it what good is he who else will harbor hun at his age for the little he can do what help he is theres no depending on off he goes always when i need him most he thinks he ought to earn a little pay enough at least to buy tobacco with so he wont have to beg and be beholden call right i say  cant afford to pay any fixed wages though i wish i could csomeone else can then someone else will have to i shouldnt mind his bettering himself if that was what it was you can be certain when he begins like that theres someone at hun trying to coax

asleep beside the stove when i came up from rowes i found him here huddled against the barndoor fast asleep a miserable sight andfrightening too you neednt smile didnt recognize him i wasnt looking for himand hes changed wait till you see where did you say hed beent he didnt say i dragged him to the house and gave him tea and tried to make him ske i tried to make him talk about his travels nothing would do he just kept nodding off what did he say did he say anything but little anything mary confess he said hed come to ditch the meadow for nle warrenl i but did he i just want to know ofcotirsehe did what would you have him say surely youwouldnt grudge the poorold man some humble way tosave his selfrespect he added if you really care to know g zp rs      he meant to clear the upper pasture too that sounds like something you have heard before warren i wish you could have heard the way he jumbled everything i stopped to look  two or three timeshe made me feel so queer to see if he was talking in his sleep he ran on harold wilsonyou remember the boy you had in haying four years since hes finished school and teaching in his college silas declares youll have to get him back he says they two will make a team for work between them they will lay this farm as smoothi the way he mixed that in with other things he thinks young wilson a likely lad though daft on educationyou know how they fought all through july under the blazing sun silas up on the cart to build the load harold along beside to pitch it on yes i took care to keep well out of earshot well those days trouble silas like a dream you wouldnt think they would how some things lmgerr harolds young college boys assurance piqued him mter so many years he still keeps finding good arguments he sees he might have used i sympathize i know just how it feels to think of the right thing to say too late harolds associated in his mind with latin lie asked me what i thought of harolds saying he studied latin like the violin because he liked itthat an argumenti he said he couldnt make the boy believe    he could find water with a hazel prong which showed how much good school had ever done hirg he wanted to go over that but most of all he thinks if he could have another chance to teach him how to build a load of hay i know thats silas one accomplishment he bundles every forkful in its place and tags and numbers it for future reference so he can find and easily dislodge it in the unloading silas does that well he takes it out in bunches like big birds nests you never see him standing on the hay hes trying to lift straining to lift himself he thinks if he could teach him that hed be some good perhaps to someone in the world he hates to see a boy the fool of books poor silas so concerned for other folk and

light poured softly in her lap she saw it and spread her apron to it she put out her hand among the harplike morningglory strings taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves as if she played unheard some tenderness that wrought on mmbeside her in the night warren she said he has come home to die you neednt be afraid hell leave you this time    home he mocked gently yes what else but home it all depends on what you mean by home of course hes nothing to us any more than was the hound that came a stranger to us out of the woods worn out upon the trail home is the place where when you have to go there they have to take you in  should have called it something you somehow havent to deserve warren leaned out and took a step or two picked up a little stick and brought it back and broke it in his hand and tossed it by silas has better claim on us you think than on his brother thirteen little miles as the road winds would bring him to his door silas has walked that far no doubt today why doesnt he go there his brothers rich a somebodydirector in the bank he never told us that we know it though i think his brother ought to help of course ill see to that if there is need he ought of right to take him in and might be willing to he may be better than appearances but have some pity on silas do you think    if he had any pride in claiming kin or anything he looked for from his brother hed keep so sbu about him all this time  wonder whats between them  can tell you silas is what he iswe wouldnt mind him but just the kind that kinsfolk cant abide he never did a thing so very bad he dont know why he isnt quite as good as anybody worthless though he is he wont be made ashamed to please his brother no but he hurt my heart the way he lay and rolled ius old head on that sharpedged chairback he wouldnt let me put him on the lounge you must go in and see what you can do made the bed up for him there tonight youll be surpnsed at himhow much hes broken his workmg days are done im

may not speak of it and then he may ill sit and see if that small sailing cloud will hit or iniss the moon    it hit the timon then there were three there making a dim row the moon the little silver cloud and she warren returnedtoo soon it seemed to her slipped to her side caught up her hand and waited warren she questioned dead was all he answered    the mountain the mountain held the town as in a shadow i saw so much before i slept there once i noticed that i missed stars in the west where its black body cut into the sky near me it seemed i felt it like a wall behind which i was sheltered from a wind and yet between the town and it i found  e n i walked forth at dawn to see new things were fields a river and beyond more fields the river at the time was fallen away and made a widespread brawl on cobblestones but the signs showed what it had done in spring good grassland gullied out and in the grass ridges of sand and driftwood stripped of bark i crossed the river and swung round the mountain and there i met a man who moved so slow with whitefaced oxen in a heavy cart it seemed no harm to stop him altogether at town is this i asked this lunenburg then i was wrong the town of my sojourn beyond the bridge was not that of the mountain but only felt at night its shadowy presence ere is your village very far from here there is no villageonly scattered farms we were but sixty voters last election w e cant in nature grow to many more    that thing takes all the room he moved his goad the mountain stood there to be pointed at pasture ran up the side a little way and then there was a wall of trees with trunks after that only tops of trees and cliffs imperfectly concealed among the leaves a dry ravine emerged from under boughs into the pasture that looks like a path is that the way to reach the top from here not for this morning but some other time i must be getting back to breakfast now i dont advise your trying from this side there is no proper path but those that have been up i understand have climbed from ladds thats five miles back you cant mistake the place they logged it there last winter some way up id take you but im bound the other way youve never climbed it ive been on the sides deerhunting and troutfishing theres a brook that starts up on it somewhereive heard say right on the top tiptopa curious thing but what would interest you about the brook its always cold in summer warm in winter one of the great sights going is to see it steam in winter like an oks breath until the bushes all along its banks are inchdeep with the frosty spines and bristles you know the kind then let the sun shine on it j   there ought to be a view around the world from such a mountainif it isnt wooded clear to the top i saw through leafy screens great granite terraces in sun and shadow shelves one could rest a knee on getting up with depths behind him sheer a hundred feet or tum and sit on and look out and down with little ferns in crevices at his elbow as to that i cant say but theres the spring right on the summit ahnost like a fowltrun that ought to be worth seeing if its therl you never saw it i guess theres no doubt about its being there i never suw it it may not be right on the very top it wouldnt have to be a long way down to have some head of water from above and a good distance down might not be noticed by anyone whod come a long way up one time i asked a fellow climbing it to look and tell me later how it was what did he say the said there was q lak somewhere in ireland on a mountain top ut a lakes different what about the spring    che never got up mgh enough to see thats why i dont advise your trying this side he tried this side ive always meant to go and look myself but you know how it is it doesnt seem so much to

the familis all away in some back meadow theres a hay load acorningwhen it comes and later still they all get driven in the fields are stripped to lawn the garden patches stripped to bare ground the maple trees to whips and poles theres nobody about the chimney though keeps up a good brisk smokmg and i he back and ride i take the reins only when someones coming and the mare stops when she hkes i

door the doctor slid a httle down the pillow    home burial he saw her from the bottom of the stairs before she saw him she was startmg down looking back over her shoulder at some fear she took a doubtful stcp and then undid it to raise herself and look agam he spoke advancmg toward her what is it you see from up there alwaysfor i want to know she turned and sank upon her skirts at that and her face changed from temfled to dull he said to gain time what is it you see mounting until she cowered under him i will find out nowyou must tell me dear she in her place refused mmany help with the least stiffening of her neck and silence she let him look sure that he wouldnt see blind creature and awhile he didnt see but at last he murmured oh and again coh cwhat is itwhat she said jnst that i see you don she challenged tell me what it is the wonder is i didnt see at once i never noticed it from here before i must be wonted to itthats the reason the little graveyard where my people are so small the window frames the whole of it not so much larger than a bedroom is it there are three stones of slate and one of marble    broadshouldered little slabs there in the sunhght on the sidelnll we havent to mind those but i understand it is not the stones but the childs mound dont dont dont dont she cried she withdrew shrmking from beneath his arm that rested on the bannister and slid downstairs and turned on him with such a daunting look he said twice over before he knew lnmself cant a man speak of his own child hes lost not you oh wheres my hat oh i dont need itl i must get out of here i must get air i dont know rightly whether any man can amyl dont go to someone else this time listen to me i wont come down the stairs he sat and fixed his chin between his fists theres something i should like to ask you dear you dont know how to ask it help me then her fingers moved the latch for all reply my words are nearly always an offense i dont know how to speak of anything so as to please you but i might be taught i should suppose i cant say i see how a man must partly give up being a man with womenfolk we could have some arrangement    by which id bind myself to keep hands off anything special youre amind to name though i dont like such things twixt those that love two that dont love cant live together without them but two that do cant hve together with them she moved the latch a little dontdont go dont carry it to someone else this time tell me about it if its something human let me into your grief im not so muh unlike other folks as your standing there apart would make me out give me my chance i do think though you overdo it a httle what was it brought you up to think it the thing to take your motherloss of a first child so inconsolablyin the face of love youd think his memory might be satisfied there you go sneering now im not im not you make me angry ill come down to you god what a woman and it s come to this a man cant speak of his own child thats dead cyou cant because you dont know how to speak if you had any feelings you that dug with your own handhow could youhis little grave i saw you from that very window there making the gravel leap and leap in air leap up like that like that and land so lightly and roll back down the mound beside the hole i thought who is that man i didnt know you and i crept down the stairs and up the stairs    to look again and still your spade kept lifting then you came in i heard your rumbling voice out in the kitchen and i dont know why but i went near to see with my own eyes you could sit there with the struns on your shoes of the fresh earth from your own babys grave and talk about your everyday concerns you had stood the spade up against the wall outside there in the entry for i saw it ci shall laugh the worst laugh i ever laughed im cursed god if i dont believe im cursed ci can repeat the very words you were saying cthree foggy mornmgs and one rainy day will rot the best birch fence a man can build think of it talk like that at such a time what had how long it takes a birch to rot to do with what was in the darkened parlor you couldnt carel the nearest friends can go with anyone to death comes so far short they might as well not try to go at all no from the time when one is sick to death one is alone and he dies more alone friends make pretense of following to the grave but before one is in it their minds are turned and malang the best of their way back to hfe and living people and things they understand but the worlds evil i wont have grief so if i can change it oh i wont i wonti there you have said it all and you feel better you wont go now youre crying close the door    the hearts gone out of it why keep it up amy theres someone coming down the roadl cyouoh you thmk the talk is all i must go somewhere out of this house how can i make you ifyoudor she was opening the door wider where do you mean to go first tell me that ill follow and bring you back by force i willl  j   the black cottage we chanced in passing by that afternoon to catch it in a sort of special picture among tarbanded ancient cherry trees set well back from the road in rank lodged grass the little cottage we were speaking of a front with jst a door between two windows fresh painted by the shower a velvet black we paused the minister and i to look he made as if to hold it at arms length or put the leaves aside that framed it in pretty he said come in no one will care the path was a vague parting in the grass that led us to a weathered windowsill we pressed our faces to the pane you see he said everythings as she left it when she died her sons wont sell the house or the thing mit they say they mean to come and summer here where they were boys they havent come this year they live so far awayone is out west it will be hard for them to keep their word anyway they wont have the place disturbed a buttoned haircloth lounge spread scrolling arms under a crayon portrait on the wall done sadly from an old daguerreotype that was the father as he went to war she always when she talked about the war sooner or later came and leaned half knelt against the lounge beside it though i doubt h such unhfelike lines kept power to stir anything in her after all the years he fell at gettysburg or fredericksbuig    i ought to knowit makes a difference which fredericksburg wasnt gettysburg of course but what im getting to is how forsaken a little cottage this has always seemed since she went more than ever but before i dont mean altogether by the hves that had gone out of it the father first then the two sons till she was left alone nothing could draw her after those two sons she valued the considerate neglect she had at some cost taught them after years i mean by the worlds having passed it by as we almost got by this afternoon it always seems to me a sort of mark to measure how far fifty years have brought us why not sit down if you are in no haste these doorsteps seldom have a visitor the warping boards pull out their own old nails with none to tread and put them in their place she had her own idea of things the old lady and she liked talk she had seen garrison and whittier and had her story of them one wasnt long in learning that she thought whatever else the civil war was for it wasnt just to keep the states together nor just to free the slaves though it did both she wouldnt have believed those ends enough to have given outright for them all she gave her giving somehow touched the principle that all men are created free and equal and to hear her quaint phrasesso removed from the worlds view today of all those things thats a hard mystery of jeffersons    what did he mean of course the easy way is to decide it simply isnt true it may not be i heard a fellow say so but never mind the welshman got it planted where it will trouble us a thousand years each age will have to reconsider it you couldnt tell her what the west was saying and what the south to her serene belief she had some art of hearing and yet not hearing the latter wisdom of the world white was the only race she ever knew black she had scarcely seen and yellow never but how could they be made so very unlike by the same hand working in the same stuff she had supposed the war decided that what are you going to do with such a person strange how such innocence gets its own way i shouldnt be surprised if in this world it were the force that would at last prevail do you know but for her there was a time when to please younger members of the church or rather say nonmembers in the church whom we all have to think of nowadays i would have changed the creed a very little not that she ever had to ask me not to it never got so far as that but the bare thought of her old tremulous bonnet in the pew and of her half asleep was too much for me why i might wake her up and startle her it was the words descended into hades that seemed too pagan to our liberal youth you know they suffered from a general onslaught and well if they werent true why keep right on    saying them like the heathen we could drop them onlythere was the bonnet in the pew such a phrase couldnt have meant much to her but suppose she had missed it from the creed as a child misses the unsaid goodnight and falls asleep with heartachehow should i feel im just as glad she made me keep hands off for dear me why abandon a belief merely because it ceases to be true cling to it long enough and not a doubt it will tum true again for so it goes most of the change we think we see in life is due to truths being in and out of favor as i sit here and oftentimes i wish i could be monarch of a desert land i could devote and dedicate forever to the truths we keep coming back and back to so desert it would have to be so walled by mountain ranges half in summer snow no one would covet it or think it worth the pains of conquering to force change on scattered oases where men dwelt but mostly sand dunes held loosely in tamarisk blown over and over themselves in idleness sand grains should sugar in the natal dew the babe born to the desert the sand stonn retard midwaste my cowering caravans there are bees in this wall he struck the clapboards fierce heads looked out small bodies pivoted we rose to go sunset blazed on the windows j   blueberries you ought to have seen what i saw on my way to the village through pattersons pasture today blueberries as big as the end of your thumb real skyblue and heavy and ready to drum in the cavernous pail of the first one to come and all ripe together not some of them green and some of them ripe you ought to have seeni i dont know what part of the pasture you mean you know where they cut off the woodslet me see it was two years agoor nocan it be no longer than thatand the following fall the fire ran and burned it all up but the wall why there hasnt been time for the bushes to grow thats always the way with the blueberries though there may not have been the ghost of a sign of them anywhere under the shade of the pine but get the pine out of the way you may burn the pasture all over until not a fern or grassblade is left not to mention a stick and presto theyre up all around you as thick and hard to explain as a conjurors trick it must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit i taste in them sometimes the flavor of soot and after all really theyre ebony skinned the blues but a mist from the breath of the wind a tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand and less than the tan with which pickers are tanned j   does patterson know what he has do you think he may and not care and so leave the chewink to gather them for himyou know what he is he wont make the fact that theyre rightfully his an excuse for keeping us other folk out i wonder you didnt see loren about the best of it was that i did do you know i was just getting through what the field had to show and over the wall and into the road when who should come by with a democratload of all the young chattering lorens alive but loren the fatherly out for a drive he saw you then what did he do did he frown he just kept nodding his head up and down you know how politely he always goes by but he thought a big thought could tell by his eye which being expressed might be this in effect i have left those there berries i shrewdly suspect to ripen too long i am greatly to blame  hes a thriftier person than some i could name he seems to be thrifty and hasnt he need with the mouths of all those young lorens to feed he has brought them all up on wild berries they say like birds they store a great many away they eat them the year round and those they dont eat they sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet j   who cares what they say its a nice way to live just taking what nature is willing to give not forcing her hand with harrow and plow i wish you had seen his perpetual bow and the air of the youngsters no one of them turned and they looked so solemnabsurdly concerned i wish i knew half what the hock of them know of where all the berries and other things grow cranberries in bogs and raspberries on top oftheboulderstrewnmountainandwhentheywillcrop i met them one day and each had a hower stuck into his berries as fresh as a shower some strange kindthey told me it hadnt a name ive told you how once not long after we came i almost provoked poor loren to mirth by going to him of all people on earth to ask if he knew any fruit to be had for the picking the rascal he said hed be glad to tell if he knew but the year had been bad there had been some berriesbut those were all gone he didnt say where they had been he went on im sureim sureas polite as could be he spoke to his wife in the door let me see mame we dont know any good berrying place it was all he could do to keep a straight face u he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him hell find hes mistaken see here for a whim well pick in the pattersons pasture this year well go in the moming that is if its clear    and the sun shines out warm the vines must be wet its so long since i picked i almost forget how we used to pick berries we took one look round then sank out of sight like trolls underground and saw nothing more of each other or heard unless when you said i was keeping a bird away from its nest and i said it was you well one of us is for complaining it hew around and around us and then for a while we picked till i feared you had wandered a mile and i thought i had lost you i lifted a shout too loud for the distance you were it turned out for when you made answer your voice was as low as talkingyou stood up beside me vou know we shant have the place to ourselves to enjoy not likely when all the young lorens deploy theyll be there tomorrow or even tonight they wont be too friendlythey may be polite to people they look on as having no right to pick where theyre picking but we wont complain you ought to have seen how it looked in the rain the fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves like two kinds of jewels a vision for thieves    a servant to servants i didnt make you know how glad i was to have you come and camp here on our land i promised myself to get down some day and see the way you lived but i dont know with a houseful of hungry men to feed i guess youd find    it seems to me i cant express my feelings any more than i can raise my voice or want to lift my hand oh i can lift it when i have to did ever you feel so i hope you never its got so i dont even know for sure whether i am glad sorry or anything theres nothing but a voicelike left inside that seems to tell me how i ought to feel and would feel if i wasnt all gone wrong you take the lake i look and look at it i see its a fair pretty sheet of water i stand and make myself repeat out loud the advantages it has so long and narrow like a deep piece of some old running river cut short off at both ends i t lies five miles straight away through the mountain notch from the sink window where i wash the plates and all our storms come up toward the house drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter it took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit to step outdoors and take the water dazzle a sunny morning or take the rising wind about my face and body and through my wrapper when a storm threatened from the dragons den and a cold chill shivered across the lake j   i see its a fair pretty sheet of water our willoughby how did you hear of it i expect though everyones heard of it in a book about ferns listen to that you let things more like feathers regulate your going and coming and you like it here i can see how you might but i dont know it would be different if more people came for then there would be business as it is the cottages len built scmetimes we rent them sometimes we dont weve a good piece of shore that ought to be worth something and may yet but i dont count on it as much as len he looks on the bright side of everything including me he thinks ill be all right with doctoring but its not medicine lowe is the only doctors dared to say so its rest i wantthere i have said it out from cooking meals for hungry hired men and washing dishes after themfrom doing things over and over that just wont stay done by good rights i ought not to have so much put on me but there seems no other way len says one steady pull more ought to do it he says the best way out is always through and i agree to that or in so far as that i can see no way out but through leastways for meand then theyll be convinced its not that len dont want the best for me it was his plan our moving over in beside the lake from where that day i showed you we used to liveten miles from anywhere we didnt change without some sacrifice    but len went at it to make up the loss his works a mans of course from sun to sun but he works when he works as hard as i do though theres small profit in comparisons women and men will make them all the same but work aint all len undertakes too much hes into everything in town this year ies highways and hes got too many men around him to look after that make waste they take advantage of him shamefully and proud too o themselves for doing so we have four here to board great goodfornothings sprawling about the kitchen with their talk while i fry their bacon much they care no more put out in what they do or say than if i wasnt in the room at all coming and going all the time they are i dont learn what their names are let alone their characters or whether they are safe to have inside the house with doors unlocked im not afraid of them though if theyre not mraid of me theres two can play at that i have my fancies it runs in the family my fathers brother wasnt right they kept him locked up for years back there at the old farm ive been away onceyes ive been away the state asylum i was prejudiced i wouldnt have sent anyone of mine there you know the old ideathe only asylum was the poorhouse and those who could afford rather than send their folks to such a place kept them at home and it does seem more human but its not so the place is the asylum j   there they have every means proper to do with and you arent darkening other peoples lives worse than no good to them and they no good to you in your condition you cant mow affection or the want of it in that state ive heard too much of the oldfashioned way my fathers brother he went mad quite young some thought he had been bitten by a dog because his violence took on the form of carrying his pillow in his teeth but its more likely he was crossed in love or so the story goes it was some girl anyway all he talked about was love they soon saw he would do someone a mischief if he want kept strict watch of and it ended in fathers building him a sort of cage or room within a room of hickory poles like stanchions in the barn from floor to ceiling a narrow passage all the way around anything they put in for furniture hed tear to pieces even a bed to lie on so they made the place comfortable with straw like a beasts stall to ease their consciences of course they had to feed him without dishes they tried to keep him clothed but he paraded with his clothes on his armall of his clothes cruelit sounds i spose they did the best they mew and just when he was at the height father and mother married and mother came a bride to help take care of such a creature and accommodate her young life to his that was what marrying father meant to her she had to lie and hear love things made dreadful    by his shouts in the night hed shout and shout until the strength was shouted out of him and his voice died down slowly from exhaustion hed pull his bars apart like bow and bowstring and let them go and make them twang until his hands had worn them smooth as any oxbow and then hed crow as if he thought that childs play the only fun he had ive heard them say though they found a way to put a stop to it he was before my timei never saw him but the pen stayed exactly as it was there in the upper chamber in the ell a sort of catchall full of attic clutter i often think of the smooth hickory bars it got so i would sayyou know half fooling its time i took my turn upstairs in jail just as you will till it becomes a habit no wonder i was glad to get away mind you i waited till len said the word i didnt want the blame if things went wrong i was glad though no end when we moved out and i looked to be happy and i was as i said for a whilebut i dont know somehow the change wore out like a prescription and theres more to it than just windowviews and living by a lake im past such help unless len took the notion which he wont and i wont ask himits not sure enough i spose ive got to go the road im going other folks have to and why shouldnt i i almost think if i could do like you drop everything and live out on the ground but it might be come night i shouldnt like it    or a long rain i should soon get enough and be glad of a good roof overhead ive lain awake thinking of you ill warrant more thau you have yourself some of these nights the wonder was the tents werent snatched away from over you as you lay in your beds i havent courage for a risk like that bless you of course youre keeping me from work but the thing of it is i need to be kept theres work enough to dotheres always that but behinds behind the worst that you can do is set me back a little more behind i shant catch up in this world anyway id rather youd not go unless you must j   after applepicking my long twopointed ladders sticking through a tree toward heaven still and theres a barrel that i didnt fill beside it and there may be two or three apples i didnt pick upon some bough but i am done with applepicking now essence of winter sleep is on the night the scent of apples i am drowsing off i cannot rub the strangeness from my sight i got from looking through a pane of glass i skimmed this morning from the drinking trough and held against the world of hoary grass it melted and i let it fall and break but i was well upon my way to sleep before it fell and i could tell what form my dreaming was about to take magnified apples appear and disappear stem end and blossom end and every fleck of russet showing clear my instep arch not only keeps the ache it keeps the pressure of a ladderround i feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend and i keep hearing from the cellar bin the rumbling sound of load on load of apples coming in for i have had too much of applepicking i am overtired of the great harvest i myself desired there were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch cherish in hand lift down and not let fall    for all that struck the earth no matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble went surely to the ciderapple heap as of no worth one can see what will trouble this sleep of mine whatever sleep it is were he not gone the woodchuck could say whether its like his long sleep as i describe its coming on or just some human sleep    what is there wrong what did i say the code there were three in the meadow by the brook gathering up windrows piling cocks of hay with an eye always lifted toward the west where an irregular sunbordered cloud darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger flickering across its bosom suddenly one helper thrusting pitchfork in the ground marched himself off the field and home one stayed the townbred farmer failed to understand something you just now said about our taking pains  cock the haybecause its going to shower i said that more than half an hour ago r said it to myself as much as you you didnt know but james is one big fool he thought you meant to find fault with his work thats what the average farmer would have meant james would take time of course to chew it over before he acted hes just got round to act he is  fool if thats the way he takes me dont let it bother you youve found out something j   the hand that knows his business wont be told to do work better or fasterthose two things im as particular as anyone most likely id have served you just the same but i know you dont understand our ways you were just talking what was in your mind what was in all our minds and you werent hinting tell you a story of what happened once i was up here in salem at a mans named sanders with a gang of four or five doing the haying no one liked the boss he was one of the kind sports call a spider all wiry anus and legs that spread out wavy from a humped body nigh as bigs a biscuit but work that man could work especially if by so doing he could get more work out of his hired help im not denying he was hard on himself i couldnt find that he kept any hoursnot for himself daylight and lanternlight were one to him ive heard him pounding in the barn all night but what he liked was someone to encourage them that he couldnt lead hed get behind and drive the way you can you know in mowing keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off id seen about enough of his bulling tricks we call that bulling id been watching him so when he paired off with me in the hayfield to load the load thinks i look out for trouble i built the load and topped it off old sanders combed it down with a rake and says ok everything went well till we reached the barn with a big jag to empty in a bay    you understand that meant the easy job for the man up on top of throwing down the hay and rolling it off wholesale where on a mow it would have been slow lifting you wouldnt think a fellowd need much urging under those circumstances would you now but the old fool seizes his fork in both hands and looking up bewhiskered out of the pit shouts like an army captain let her come thinks i dye mean it what was that you said i asked out loud sos thered be no mistake did you say let her come yes let her come he said it over but he said it softer never you say a thing like that to a man not if he values what he is god id as soon murdered him as left out his middle name id built the load and knew right where to find it two or three forkfuls i picked lightly round for like meditating and then i just dug in and dumped the rackful on him in ten lots i looked over the side once in the dust and caught sight of him treadingwaterlike keeping his head above damn ye i says that gets yel he squeaked like a squeezed rat that was the last i saw or heard of him i cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off as i sat mopping hayseed from my neck and sort of waiting to be asked about it one of the boys sings out wheres the old man i left him in the barn under the hay if ye want him ye can go and dig him out they realized from the way i swabbed my neck more than was needed something must be up    they headed for the barn i stayed where i was they told me afterward first they forked hay a lot of it out into the barn hoor nothing they listened for him not a rustle i guess they thought id spiked him in the temple before i buried him or i couldnt have managed they excavated more cgo keep his wife out of the barn someone looked in a window and curse me if he wasnt in the kitchen slumped way down in a chair with both his feet against the stove the hottest day that summer he looked so clean disgusted from behind there was no one that dared to stir him up or let him know that he was being looked at apparently i hadnt buried him i may have knocked him down but my just trying to bury him had hurt his dignity he had gone to the house sos not to meet me he kept away from us all afternoon we tended to his hay we saw him out after a while picking peas in his garden he couldnt keep away from doing something werent you relieved to find he wasnt dead no and yet i dont knowits hard to say i went about to kill him fair enough you took an awkward way did he discharge youp discharge me nol he knew i did just right j   the generations of men a governor it was proclaimed this time when all who would come seeking in new hampshire ancestral memories might come together and those of the namt stark gathered in bow a rockstrewn town where farming has fallen off and sproutlands flourish where the ax has gone someone had literally run to earth in an old cellar hole in a byroad the origin of all the family there thence they were sprung so numerous a tribe that now not all the houses left in town made shift to shelter them without the help of here and there a tent in grove and orchard they were at bow but that was not enough nothing would do but they must fix a day to stand together on the craters verge that turned them on the world and try to fathom the past and get some itrangeness out of it but rain spoiled ali the day began uncertain with clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted the young folk held some hope out to each other till well toward noon when the stonn settled down with a swish in the grass what if the others are there they said it isnt going to rain only one from a fann not far away strolled thither not expecting he would find anyone else but out of idleness one and one other yes for there were two the second round the curving hillside road was a girl and she halted some way off to reconnoiter and then made up her mind    at least to pass by and see who he was and perhaps hear some word about the weather this was some stark she didnt know he nodded no fete today he said it looks that way she swept the heavens turning on her heel i only idlec down i idled down provision there had been for just such meeting of stranger cousins in a family tree drawn on a sort of passport with the branch of the one bearing it done in detail some zealous ones laborious device she made a sudden movement toward her bodice as one who clasps her heart they laughed together stark he inquired no matter for the proof yes stark and you im stark he drew his passport you know we might not be and still be cousins the town is full of chases lowes and baileys all claiming some priority in starkness my mother was a lane yet might have married anyone upon earth and still her children would have been starks and doubtless here today you riddle with your genealogy like a viola i dont follow you    i only mean my mother was a stark several times over and by marrying father no more than brought us back into the name one ought not to be thrown into confusion by a plain statement of relationship but i own what you say makes my head spin you take my cardyou seem so good at such things and see if you can reckon our cousinship why not take seats here on the cellar wall and dangle feet among the raspberry vines under the shelter of the family tree just sothat ought to be enough protection not from the rain i think its going to rain its raining no its misting lets be fair does the rain seem to you to cool the eyes the situation was like this the road bowed outward on the mountain halfway up and disappeared and ended not far off no one went home that way the only house beyond where they wire was a shattered seedpod and below roared a brook hidden in trees the sound of which was silence for the place this he sat listening to till she gave judgment on fathers side it seems werelet me see    dont be too technicalyou have three cards four cards one yours three mine one for each branch of the stark family im a member of dyou know a person so related to herself is supposed to be mad i may be mad you look so sitting out here in the rain studying genealogy with me you never saw before what will we come to with all this pride of ancestry we yankees i think were all mad tell me why were here drawn into town about this cellar hole like wild geese on a lake before a storm what do we see in such a hole i wonder the indians had a myth of chicamoztoc which means the seven caves that we came out of this is the pit from which we starks were digged you must be learned thats what you see in it and what do you see yes what do i see first let me look i see raspberry vines oh if youre going to use your eyes just hear what i see its a little little boy as pale and dim as a match hame in the sun    hes groping in the cellar after jam he thinks its dark and its flooded with daylight hes nothing listen when i lean like tlus i can make out old grandsir stark distinctly with his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug bless you it isnt grandsir stark its granny but the pipes there and smoking and the jug shes after cider the old girl shes thirsty heres hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely tell me about her does she look like me she should shouldnt she youre so many times over descended from her i believe she does look like you stay the way you are the nose is just the same and sos the chin making allowance making due allowance you poor dear great great great great granny see that you get her greatness right dont stint her yes its important though you think it isnt i wont be teased but see bow wet i am yes you must go we cant stay here for ever but wait until i give you a hand up a bead of silver water more or less strung on your hair wont hurt your summer looks i wanted to try something with the noise that the brook raises in the empty valley we have seen visionsnow consult the voices    something i must have learned riding in trains when i was young i used to use the roar to set the voices speaking out of it speaking or singing and the bandmusic playing perhaps you have the art of what i mean ive never listened in among the sounds that a brook makes in such a wild descent it ought to give a purer oracle its as you throw a picture on a screen the meaning of it all is out of you the voices give you what you wish to hear strangely its anything they wish to give then i dont know it must be strange enough i wonder if its not your makebelieve what do you think youre like to hear today from the sense of our having been together but why take time for what im like to hear ill tell you what the voices really say you will do very well right where you are a little longer i mustnt feel too hurried or i cant give myself to hear the voices is this some trance you are withdrawing into you must bt very still you mustnt talk  hardly breathe the voices seem to say j   im waiting dont the voices seem to say call her nausicaa the unafraid of an acquaintance made adventurously i let you say thaton consideration i dont see very well how you can help it you want the truth i speak but by the voices you see they know i havent had your name though what a name should matter between us i shall suspect be good the voices say call her nausicaa and take a timber that you shall bnd lies in the cellar charred among the raspberries and hew and shape it for a doorsill or other corner piece in a new cottage on the ancient spot the life is not yet all gone out of it and come and make your summer dwelling here and perhaps she will come still unafraid and sit before you in the open door with flowers in her lap until they fade but not come in across the sacred sill i wonder where your oracle is tending you can see that theres something wrong with it or it would speak in dialect whose voice does it purport to speak in not old grandsirs nor grannys surely call up one of them they have best right to be heard in this place    you seem so partial to our greatgrandmother nine times removed correct me if  err you will be likely to regard as sacred anything she may say but let me warn you folks in her day were given to plain speaking you think youd best tempt her at such a time it rests with us always to cut her off well then its granny speaking i dunnow mebbe im wrong to take it as  do there aint no names quite like the old ones though nor never will be to my way of thinking one mustnt bear too hard on the newcomers but theres a dite too many of them for comfort  should feel easier if  could see more of the salt wherewith theyre to be salted son you do as youre told you take the timber its as sound as the day when it was cut and begin over there shed better stop you can see what is troubling granny though but dont you think we sometimes make too much of the old stock what counts is the ideals and those will bear some keeping still about i can see we are going to be good friends i like your going to be you said just now its going to rain  know and it was raining  let you say all that but  must go now    you let me say it on consideration how shall we say goodby in such a case how shall we will you leave the way to me no i dont trust your eyes youve said enough now give me your hand uppick me that flower where shall we meet again nowhere but here once more before we meet elsewhere in rain it ought to be in rain sometime in rain in rain tomorrow shall we if it rains but if we must in sunshine so she went    the housekeeper i let myself in at the kitchen door its you she said i cant get up forgive me not answering your knock i can no more let people in than i can keep them out im getting too old for my size i tell them my fingers are dbout all ive the use of sos to take any comfort i can sew i help out with this beadwork what i can thats a smart pair of pumps youre beading there who are they for you meanoh for some miss i cant keep track of other peoples daughters lord if i were to dream of everyone whose shoes i primped to dance in and wheres john havent you seen him strange what set you off to come to his house when hes gone to yours you cant have passed each other i know what he must have changed his mind and gone to garlands he wont be long in that case you can wait though what good you can be or anyone its gone so far youve heard estelles run off yes whats it all about when id she go two weeks since shes in earnest it appears    im sure she wont come back shes hiding somewhere i dont know where myself john thinks i do he thinks i only have to say the word and shell come back but bless you im her mother i cant talk to her and lord if i couldi it will go hard with john what will he do he cant find anyone to take her place oh if you ask me that what will he do he gets some sort of bakeshop meals together with me to sit and tell him everything whats wanted and how much and where it is but when im goneof course i cant stay here estelles to take me when shes settled down he and i only hinder one another i tell them they cant get me through the door though ive been built in here like a big church organ weve been here fifteen years thats a long time to live together and then pull apart how do you see him living when youre gone two of you out will leave an empty house  dont just see him living many years left here with nothing but the furniture i hate to think of the old place when were gone with the brook going by below the yard and no one here but hens blowing about if he could sell the place but then he cant no one will ever live on it again its too run down this is the last of it    what i think he will do is let things smash hell sort of swear the time away hes awful i never saw a man let family troubles make so much difference in his mans affairs hes just dropped everything hes ike a child i blame his being brought up by his mother hes got hay down thats been rained on three times he hoed a little yesterday for me i thought the growing things would do him good something went wrong i saw him throw the hoe skyhigh with both hands i can see it now come hereill show youin that apple tree thats no way for a man to do at his age hes fiftyfive you know if hes a day arent you afraid of him whats that gun for oh thats been there for hawks since chickentime john hall touch me not if he knows his friends  say that for him johns no threatener like some menfolk n ones afraid of him all is hes made up his mind not to stand what he has got to stand where is estelle couldnt one talk to her what does she say you say you dont know where she is nor want tol she thinks if it was bad to live with him it must be right to leave him which is wrong    yes but he should have married her i know the strains been too much for her all these years i cant explain it any other way its different with a man at least with john he knows hes kinder than the run of men better than married ought to be as good as marriedthats what he has always said i lmow the way hes feltbut all the samel i wonder why he doesnt marry her and end it too late now she wouldnt have him hes given her time to think of something else thats his mistake the dear knows my interest has been to keep the thing from breaking up this is a good home i dont ask for better but when ive said why shouldnt they be married hed say why should they no more words than that and after all why should they johns been fair i take it what was his was always hers there was no quarrel about property reason enough there was no property a friend or two as good as own the farm such as it is it isnt worth the mortgage i mean estelle has always held the purse l   the rights of that are harder to get at i guess estelle and i have filled the purse twas we let him have money not he us johns a bad farmer im not blaming him take it year in year out he doesnt make much we came here for a home for me ycu know estelle to do the housework for the board of both of us but look how it turns out she seems to have the housework and besides half of the outdoor work though as for that hed say she does it more becausa she likes it you see our pretty things are all outdoors our hens and cows and pigs are always better than folks like us have any business with farmers around twice as well off as we havent as good they dont go with the farm one thing you cant help liking about john hes fond of nice thingstoo fond some would say but estelle dont complain shes like him there she wants our hens to be the best there are you never saw this room before a show full of lank shivery halfdrowned birds in separate coops having their plumage done the smell of the wet feathers in the heat you spoke of johns not being safe to stay with you dont know what a gentle lot we are we wouldnt hurt a hen you ought to see us moving a hock of hens from place to place were not allowed to take them upside down all we can hold together by the legs two at a times the rule one on each arm no matter how far and how many times we have to go    you mean thats johns idea and we live up to it or i dont know what childishness he wouldnt give way to he manages to keep the upper hand on his own farm hes boss but as to hens we fence our flowers in and the hens range nothings too good for tjem we say it pays john likes to tell the offers he has had twenty for this cock twentyfive for that he never takes the money if theyre worth that much to sell theyre worth as much to keep bless you its all expense though reach me down the little tin box on the cupboard shelf the upper shelf the tin box thats the one ill show you here you are whats this ca bill for fifty dollars for one langshang cock receipted and the cock is in the yard not in a glass case then hed need a tall one he can eat off a barrel from the ground hes been in a glass case as you may say the crystal palace london hes imported john bought him and we paid the bill with beads wampum i call it mind we dont complain ut you see dont you we take care of him    and like it too it makes it all the worse it seems as if and thats not all hes helpless in ways that i can hardly tell you of sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts to see where all the money goes so fast you know now men will be ridiculous but its just fun the way he gets bedeviled if hes untidy now what will he be it makes it all the worse you must be blind estelles the one you neednt talk to me cant you and i get to the root of it whats the real trouble what will satisfy her its as i say shes turned from him thats all but why when shes well off is it the neighbors being cut off from friends we have our friends that isnt it folks arent afraid of us shes let it worry her you stood the strain and youre her mother but i didnt always i didnt relish it along at first but i got wonted to it and besides john said i was too old to have grandchildren    but whats the use of talking when its done she wont come backits worse than thatshe cant why do you speak like that what do you know what do you meanshes done harm to herself i mean shes marriedmarried someone else ohoohor you dont believe me yes i do only too well i knew there must be something so that was what was back shes bad thats alll bad to get married when she had the chance nonsense see what shes done but who but who whod marry her straight out of such a mess say it right outno matter for her mother the man was found rd better name no names john himself wont imagine who he is then its all up i think ill get away youll be expecting john i pity estelle i suppose she deserves some pity too you ought to have the kitchen to yourself to break it to him you may have the job you neednt think youre going to get away johns almost here ive had my eye on someone coming down ryans hill i thought twas him    here he is now this boxl put it away and this bill whats the hurry hell unhitch no he wont either hell just drop the reins and turn doll out to pasture rig and all she wont get far before the wheels hang up on somethingtheres no harm see there he is my but he looks as if he must have heard john threw the door wide but he didnt enter how are you neighbor just the man im after isnt it hell he said i want to know come out here if you want to hear me talk ill talk to you old woman afterward ive got some news that maybe isnt news what are they trying to do to me these two do go along with him and stop his shouting she raised her voice against the closing door who wants to hear your news youdreadful fool j   the fear a lantern light from deeper in the barn shone on a man and woman in the door and threw their lurching shadows on a house nearby all dark in every glossy window a horses hoof pawed once the hollow floor and the back of the gig they stood beside moved in a little the man grasped a wheel the woman spoke out sharply whoa stand still i saw it just as plain as a white plate she said as the light on the dashboard ran along the bushes at the roadsidea mans face you must have seen it too i didnt see it yes im sure it was a face joel ill have to look i cant go in i cant and leave a thing like that unsettled doors locked and curtains drawn will make no differene i always have felt strange when we came home to the dark house after so long an absence and the key rattled loudly into place seemed to warn someone to be getting out at one door as we entered at another what if im right and someone all the time dont hold my arm are you sure    i say its someone passing you speak as if this were a traveled road you forget where we are what is beyond that hed be going to or coming from at such an hour of night and on foot too what was he standing still for in the bushes its not so very lateits only dark theres more in it than youre inclined to say did he look like he looked like anyone  never rest tonight unless i know give me the lantern you dont want the lantern she pushed past him and got it for herself youre not to come she said this is my business if the times come to face it im the one to put it the right way hed never dare listen he kicked a stone hear that hear thatl hes coming towards us joel go inplease harki dont hear him now but please go in in the first place vou cant make me believe its t isor someone else hes sent to watch and nows the time to have it out with him while we know definitely where he is let him get off and hell be everywhere lis   around us looking out of trees and bushes till i shant dare to set a foot outdoors and i cant stand it joel let me gol but its nonsense to think hed care enough you mean you couldnt understand his caring oh but you see he hadnt had enough joel i wonti wonti promise you we mustnt say hard things you mustnt either ill be the one if anybody goes but you give him the advantage with this light what couldnt he do to us standing here and if to see was what he wanted why he has seen all there was to see and gone he appeared to forget to keep his hold but advanced with her as she crossed the grass what do you want she cried to all the dark she stretched up tall to overlook the light that hung in both hands hot against her skirt theres no one so youre wrong he said there is what do you want she cried and then herself wa startled when an answer really came nothing it came from well along the road she reached a hand to joel for support the smell of scorching woolen made her faint    what are you doing round this house at night nothing a pause there seemed no more to say and then the voice again you seem afraid i saw by the way you whipped up the horse ill just come forward in the lantern light and let you see t es dojoel go backr she stood her ground against the noisy steps that came on but her body rocked a little tou see the voice said oh she looked and looked you dont seeive a child here by the hand a robber wouldnt have his family with him whats a child doing at this time of night out walking every child should have the memory of at least one longafterbedtime walk what son then i should think youd try to find somewhere to walk the highway as it happens were stopping for the fortnight down at deans    but if thats alljoelyou realize you wont think anything you understand you understand that vle have to be careful this is a very very lonely place joel she spoke as if she couldnt turn the swinging lantern lengthened to the ground it touched it struck it clattered and went out    the selfseeker willis i didnt want you here today the lawyers coming for the company im going to sell my soul or rather feet five hundred dollars for the pair you know with you the feet have nearly been the soul and if youre going to sell them to the devil i want to see you do it whens he comingt i half suspect you knew and came on purpose to try to help me drive a better bargain well if its true yours are no common feet

going to walk agailr ie thinks ill hobble its both legs and feet they must be terriblei mean to look at  havent dared to look at them uncovered through the bed blankets i remind myself of a starfish laid out with rigid points the wonder is it hdnt been your head its hard to tell you how i managed it when i saw the shaft had me by the coat    i didnt try too long to pun away or fumble for my knife to cut away i just embraced the shaft and rode it out till weiss shut off the water in the wheelpit thats how i think i didnt lose my head but my legs got their knocks against the ceiling awful why didnt they throw off the belt instead of going clear down in the wheelpit they say some time was wasted on the belt old streak of leatherdoesnt love me much because i make him spit fire at my knuckles the way ben franklin used to make the kitestring that must be it some days he wont stay on that day a woman couldnt coax him off hes on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth snatched right and left across the silver pulleys everything goes the same without me there you can hear the small buzz saws whine the big saw caterwaul to the hills around the village as they both bite the wood its all our music one ought as a good villager to like it no doubt it has a sort of prosperous sound and its our life yes when its not our death you make that sound as if it wasnt so with everything what we

a little barefoot girl who in the noise of heavy footsteps in the old frame house and baritone importance of the lawyer stood for a while unnoticed with her hands shyly behind her well and how is mister the lawyer was already in his satchel as if for papers that might bear the name he hadnt at command you must excuse me i dropped in at the mill and was detained looking round i suppose said willis yes well yes    hear anything that might prove useful the broken one saw anne why here is anne what do you want dear come stand by the bed tell me what is it anne just wagged her dress with both hands held behind her guess she said oh guess which hand my my once on a time  knew a lovely way to tell for certain by looking in the ears but i forget it er let me see  think ill take the right

seldom to be had in bushel lotsdoesnt come on the market but anne im troubled have you told me all youre hiding something thats as bad as lying you ask this lawyer man and its not safe with a lawyer at hand to find you out nothing is hidden from some people anne you dont tell me that where you found a rams hom you didnt find a yellow ladys slipper what did i tell you what id blush i would dont you defend yourself if it was there where is it now the yellow ladys slipper well waitits commonits too common the purple ladys slippers commoner i didnt bring a purple ladys slipper common to youto

though pressed into service means pressed out of shape somehow ill make it right with hershell see shes going to do my scouting in the field over stone walls and all along a wood and by a river bank for water flowers the floating heart with small leaf like a heart    and at the sinus under water a fist of little fingers all kept down but one and that thrust up to blossom in the sun as if to say toul youre the hearts desire anne has a way with flowers to take the place of what shes lost she goes down on one knee and lifts their faces by the chin to hers and says their names and leaves them where they are the lawyer wore a watch the case of which was cunningly devised to make a noise like a small pistol when he snapped it shut at such a time as this he snapped it now well anne go dearie our affair will wait the lawyer man is thinking of his train he wants to give me lots and lots of money before he goes because i hurt myself and it may take him i dont know how long but put our flowers in water first will help her the pitchers too full for her theres no cup just hook them on the inside of the pitcher now runget out your documents you see i have to keep on the good side of anne im a great boy to think of number one and you cant blame me in the place im in who will take care of my necessities unless i do a pretty interlude the lawyer said im sorry but my train luckily

folkss legal documents out with it if youve any real objection five hundred dollars what would you think right a thousand wouldnt be a cent too much you know it mr lawyer the sin is accepting anything before he knows whether hes ever going to walk again it smells to me like a dishonest trick  thinki thinkfrom what i heard today and saw myselfhe would be illadvised what did you hear for instance willis said     now the place where the accident occurred the broken one was twisted in his bed this is between you two apparently where i come in is what i want to know you stand up to it like a pair

my flowers you dont know what i mean about the flowers dont stop to try to now youll miss your train goodby he flung his arms around his face    the woodpile out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day i paused and said i will turn back from here no i will go on fartherand we shall see the hard snow held me save where now and then one foot went through the view was all in lines straight up and down of tall slim trees too much alike to mark or name a place by so as to say for certain i was here or somewhere else i was just far from horne a small bird flew before me he was careful to put a tree between us when he lighted and say no word to tell me who he was who was so foolish as to think what he thought he thought that i was after him for a feather the white one in his tail like one who takes everything said as personal to himself one flight out sideways would have undeceived him and then there was a pile of wood for which i forgot him and let his little fear carry him off the way i might have gone without so much as wishing him goodnight he went behind it to make his last stand it was a cord of maple cut and split and piledand measured four by four by eight and not another like it could i see no runner tracks in this years snow looped near it and it was older sure than this years cutting or even last years or the years before the wood was gray and the bark warping off it and the pile somewhat sunken clematis had wound strings round and round it like a bundle    what held it though on one side was a tree still growing and on one a stake and prop these latter about to fall i thought that only someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks could so forget his handiwork on which he spent himself the labor of his ax and leave it there far from a useful fireplace to warm the frozen swamp as best it could with the slow smokeless burning of decay fl   good hours i had for my winter evening walk no one at all with whom to talk but i had the cottages in a row up to their shining eyes in snow and i thought i had the folk within i had the sound of a violin i had a glimpse through curtain laces of youthful forms and youthful faces i had such company outward bound i went till there were no cottages found i turned and repented but coming back i saw no window but that was black over the snow my creaking feet disturbed the slumbering village street like profanation by your leave at ten oclock of a winter eve    mount ain interv al   the road not taken two roads diverged in a yellow wood and sorry i could not travel both and be one traveler long i stood and looked down one as far as i could to where it bent in the undergrowth then took the other as just as fair and having perhaps the better claim because it was grassy and wanted wear though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same and both that morning equally lay in leaves no step had trodden black oh i kept the first for another dayl yet knowing how way leads on to way i doubted if i should ever come back i shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence two roads diverged in a wood and i  i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference j   christmas trees a christmas circular letter the city had withdrawn into itself and left at last the country to the country when between whirls of snow not come to lie and whirls of foliage not yet laid there drove a stranger to our yard who looked the city yet did in country fashion in that there he sat and waited till he drew us out abuttoning coats to ask him who he was he proved to be the city come again to look for something it had left behind and could not do without and keep its christmas he asked if i would sell my christmas trees my woodsthe young fir balsams like a place where houses all are churches and have spires i hadnt thought of them as christmas trees i doubt if i was tempted for a moment to sell them off their feet to go in cars and leave the slope behind the house all bare where the sun shines now no wanner than the mood id hate to have them know it if i was yet more id hate to hold my trees except as others hold theirs or refuse for them beyond the time of profitable growth the trial by market everything must come to i dallied so much with the thought of selling then whether from mistaken courtesy and fear of seeming short of speech or whether from hope of hearing good of what was mine i said there arent enough to be worth while     could soon tell how many they would cut you let me look them over you could look but dont expect im going to let you have them pasture they spring in some in clumps too close that lop each other of boughs but not a few quite solitary and having equal boughs all round and round the latter he nodded yes to or paused to say beneath some lovelier one with a buyers moderation that would do  thought so too but wasnt there to say so we climbed the pasture on the south crossed over and came down on the north he said a thousand a thousand christmas treesat what apiece he felt some need of softening that to me a thousand trees would come to thirty dollars then  was certain  had never meant to let him have them never show surprise but thirty dollars seemed so small beside the extent of pasture  should strip three cents for that was all they figured out apiece three cents so small beside the dollar friends i should be writing to within the hour would pay in cities for good trees like those regular vestry trees whole sunday schools could hang enough on to pick off enough    a thousand christmas trees i didnt know i had worth three cents more to give away than sell as may be shown by a simple calculation too bad i couldnt lay one in a letter i cant help wishing i could send you one in wishing you herewith a merry christmas    an old mans winter night all outofdoors looked darkly in at him through the thin frost almost in separate stars that gathers on the pane in empty rooms what kept his eyes from giving back the gaze was the lamp tilted near them in his hand what kept him from remembering what it was that brought him to that creaking room was age he stood with barrels round himat a loss and having scared the cellar under him in clomping here he scared it once again in clomping offand scared the outer night which has its sounds familiar like the roar of trees and crack of branches common things but nothing so like beating on a box a light he was to no one but himself where now he sat concerned with he knew what a quiet light and then not even that he consigned to the moon such as she was so latearising to the broken moon as better than the sun in any case for such a charge his snow upon the roof his icicles along the wall to keep and slept the log that shifted with a jolt once in the stove disturbed him and he shifted and eased his heavy breathing but still slept one aged manone mancant keep a house a farm a countryside or if he can its thus he does it of a winter night  j   the exposed nest you were forever finding some new play so when i saw you down on hands and knees in the meadow busy with the newcut hay trying i thought to set it up on end i went to show you how to make it stay if that was your idea against the breeze and if you asked me even help pretend to make it root again and grow afresh but twas no makebelieve with you today nor was the grass itself your real concern though i found your hand full of wilted fern steelbright junegrass and blackening heads of clover twas a nest full of young birds on the ground the cutterbar had just gone champing over miraculously without tasting flesh and left defenseless to the heat and light you wanted to restore them to their right of something interposed between their sight and too much world at oncecould means be found the way the nestfull every time we stirred stood iip to us as to a motherbird whose coming home has been too long deferred made roo ask would the motherbird return and care for thenl in such a change of scene and might our meddling make her more afraid that was a thing we could not wait to learn we saw the risk we took in doing good but dared not spare to do the best we could though harm should come of it so built the screen you had begun and gave them back their shade all this to prove we cared why is there then j   no more to tell we turned to other things i havent any memoryhave you of ever coming to the place again to see if the birds lived the first night through and so at ast to learn to use their wings    a patch of old snow theres a patch of old snow in a corner that i should have guessed was a blowaway paper the rain had brought to rest it is speckled with grime as if small print overspread it the news of a day ive forgotten if i ever read it    in the home stretch she stood against the kitchen sink and looked over the sink out through a dusty window at weeds the water from the sink made tall she wore her cape her hat was in her hand behind her was confusion in the room of chairs turned upside down to sit like people in other chairs and something come to look for every room a house hasparlor bedroom and dining roomthrown pellmell in the kitchen and now and then a smudged infernal face looked in a door behind her and addressed her back she always answered without turning where willi put this walnut bureau lady put it on top of something thats on top of something else she laughed oh put it where you can tonight and go its almost dark you must be getting started back to town another blackened face thrust in and looked and smiled and when she did not turn spoke gently what are you seeing out the window lady never was i beladied so before would evidence of having been called lady more than so many times make me a lady in common law i wonder but i ask what are you seeing out the window lady what ill be seeing more of in the years to come as here i stand and go the round    of many plates with towels many times and what is that you only put me off rank weeds that love the water from the dishpan more than some women like the dishpan joe a little stretch of mowingfield for you not much of that until i come to woods that end all and its scarce enough to call a view and yet you think you like it dear thats what youre so concerned to know you hope i like it bang goes something big away off there upstairs the very tread of men as great as those is shattering to the frame of such a little house once left alone you and i dear will go with softer steps up and down stairs and through the rooms and none but sudden winds that snatch them from our hands will ever slam the doors i think you see more than you like to own to out that window no for besides the things i tell you of i only see the years they come and go in alternation with the weeds the field the wood what kind of years  why latter years   different from early years you didnt count them i see them too no the further off so ran together that i didnt try to it can scarce be that they would be in number wed care to know for we are not young now and bang goes something else away off there it sounds as if it were the men went down and every crash meant one less to retunl to lighted city streets we too have known but now are giving up for country darkness come from that window where you see too much and take a livelier view of things from here theyre going watch this husky swarming up over the wheel into the skyhigh seat lighting his pipe now squinting down his nose at the flame burning downward as he sucks it see how it makes his noseside bright a proof how dark its getting can you tell what time it is by that or by the moon the new moon what shoulder did i see her over neither a wire she is of silver as new as we to everything her light wont last us long its something though to know were going to have her night after night and stronger every night to see us through our first two weeks but joe the stove before they go knock on the window ask them to help you get it on its feet we stand here dreaming hurry call them back     theyre not gone yet weve got to htlve the stove whatever else we want for and a light have we a piece of candle if the lamp and oil are buried out of reach again the house was full of tramping and the dark doorfilling men burst in and seized the stove a cannonmouthlike hole was in the wall to which they set it true by eye and then came up the jointed stovepipe in their hands so much too light and airy for their strength it almost seemed to come ballooning up slipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling a it said one and banged a stovepipe shoulder its good luck when you move in to begin with good luck with your stovepipe never mind its not so bad in the country settled down when peoplere getting on in life youlllike it joe said you big boys ought to find a farm and make good farmers and leave other fellows the city work to do theres not enough for everybody as it is in there god one said wildly and when no one spoke say that to jimmy here he needs a farm but jimmy only made his jaw recede foollike and rolled his eyes as if to say he saw himself a farmer then there was a french boy who said with seriousness that made them laugh ma friend you aint know what it is youre ask he doffed his cap and held it with both hands across his chest to make as twere a bow    were giving you our chances on de farm and then they all turned to with deafening boots and put each other bodily out of the house goodby to theml we puzzle them they think i dont know what they think we see in what they leave us to that pasture slope that seems the back some farm presents us and your woods to northward from your window at the sink waiting to steal a step on us whenever we drop our eyes or tum to other things as in the game tenstep the children play good boys they seemed and let them love the city all they could say was god when you proposed their coming out and making useful farmers did they make something lonesome go through you it would take more than them to sicken you us of our bargain but they left us so as to our fate like fools past reasoning with they almost shook me its all so much what we have always wanted i confess its seeming bad for a moment makes it seem even worse still and so on down down down its nothing its their leaving us at dusk i never bore it well when people went the first night after guests have gone the house seems haunted or exposed i always take a personal interest in the locking up at bedtime but the strangeness soon wears off he fetched a dingy lantern from behind a door theres that we didnt losel and thesel     some matches he unpocketed for food the meals weve had no one can take from us i wish that everything on earth were just as certain as the meals weve had i wish the meals we havent had were anyway what have you you know where to lay your hands on the bread we bought in passing at the store theres butter somewhere too lets rend the bread ill light the fire for company for you you not have any other company till ed begins to get out on a sunday to look us over and give us his idea of what wants pruning shingling breaking up hell know what he would do if he were we and all at once hell plan for us and plan to help us but hell take it out in planning well you can set the table with the loaf lets see you find your loaf ill light the fire i like chairs occupying other chairs not offering a lady there again joe youre tired im drunknonsensical tired out dont mind a word i say its a days work to empty one house of all household goods and fill another with em fifteen miles away although you do no more than dump them down dumped down in paradise we are and happy    its all so much what i have always wanted i cant believe its what you wanted too shouldnt you like to know id like to know if it is what you wanted then how much you wanted it for me a troubled conscience you dont want me to tell if i dont know i dont want to findout what cant be known but who first said the word to come my dear its who first thought the thought youre searching joe for things that dont exist i mean beginnings ends and beginningsthere are no such things there are only middles what is this this life our sitting here by lanternlight together amid the wreckage of a former home you wont deny the lantern isnt new the stove is not and you are not to me nor i to you perhaps you never were it would take me forever to recite all thats not new in where we find ourselves    new is a word for fools in towns who think style upon style in dress and thought at last must get somewhere ive heard you say as much no this is no beginning then an end end is a gloomy word is it too late to drag you out for just a goodnight call on the old peach trees on the knoll to grope by starlight in the grass for a last peach the neighbors may not have taken as their right when the house wasnt lived in fve been looking  doubt if they have left us many grapes before we set ourselves to right the house the first thing in the morning out we go to go the round of apple cherry peach pine alder pasture mowing well and brook all of a farm it is i know this much im going to put you in your bed if first i have to make you build it come the light when there was no more lantern in the kitchen the fire got out through crannies in the stove and danced in yellow wrigglers on the ceiling as much at home as if theyd always danced there    the telephone when i was just as far as i could walk from here today there was an hour all still when leaning with my head against a flower i heard you talk dont say i didnt for i heard you say you spoke from that flower on the window sill do you remember what it was you said first tell me what it was you thought you heard chaving found the flower and driven a bee away i leaned my head and holding by the stalk i listened and i thought i caught the word what was it did you call me by my name or did you say someone said comei heard it as i bowed i may have thought as much but not aloud well so i came    meeting and passing as i went down the hill along the wall there was a gate i had leaned at for the view and had just turned from when i first saw you as you came up the hill we met but all we did that day was mingle great and small footprints in summer dust as if we drew the figure of our being less than two but more than one as yet your parasol pointed the decimal off with one deep hrust and all the time we talked you seemed to see something down there to smile at in the dust oh it was without prejudice to mel mterward i went past what you had passed before we met and you what i had passed    hyla brook by june our brooks run out of song and speed sought for much after that it will be found either to have gone groping underground and taken with it all the hyla breed that shouted in the mist a month ago like ghost of sleighbells in a ghost of snow or flourished and come up in jewelweed weak foliage that is blown upon and bent even against the way its waters went its bed is left a faded paper sheet of dead leaves stuck together by the heat a brook to none but who remember long this as it will be seen is other far than with brooks taken otherwhere in song we love the things we love for what they are j   the oven bird there is a singer everyone has heard loud a midsummer and a midwood bird who makes the solid tree trunks sound again he says that leaves are old and that for flowers midsummer is to spring as one to ten he says the early petalfau is past when pear and cherry bloom went down in showers on sunny days a moment overcast and comes that other fall we name the fall he says the highway dust is over all the bird would cease and be as other birds but that he knows in singing not to sing the question that he frames in all but words is what to make of a diminished thing  j   bond and free love has earth to which she clings with hills and circling arms about wall within wall to shut fear out but thought has need of no such things for thought has a pair of dauntless wings on snow and sand and turf i see where love has left a printed trace with straining in the worlds embrace and such is love and glad to be but thought has shaken his ankles free thought cleaves the interstellar gloom and sits in sirius disc all night till day makes him retrace his flight with smell of burning on every plume back past the sun to an earthly room his gains in heaven are what they are yet some say love by being thrall and simply staying possesses all in several beauty that thought fares far to find fused in another star    birches when i see birches bend to left and right across lhe lines of straighter darker trees i like to think some boys been swinging them but swinging doesnt bend them down to stay as icestorms co often you must have seen them loaded h ice a sunny winter morning mter a rain they click upon themselves as the breeze rises and turn manycolored as the stir cracks and crazes their enamel soon the suns wannth makes them shed crystal shells shattering and avalanching on the snowcrust such heaps of broken glass to sweep away youd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen they are dragged to the withered bracken by the load and they seem not to break though once they are bowed so low for long they never right themselves you may see their trunks arching in the woods years afterwards trailing their leaves on the ground like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair before them over their heads to dry in the sun but i was going to say when truth broke in with all her matteroffact about the icestorm i should prefer to have some boy bend them as he went out and in to fetch the cows some boy too far from town to learn baseball whose only play was what he found himself summer or winter and could play alone one by one he subdued his fathers trees by riding them down over and over again until he took the stiffness out of them and not one but hung limp not one was left    for him to conquer he learned all there was to learn about not launching out too soon and so not carrying the tree away clear to the ground he always kept his poise to the top branches climbing carefully with the same pains you use to ll a cb up to the brim and even abo thfubchp then he hung outward feet rst thllvish kicking his way down through eif to te ground  iv   so was i once myself a swinger ofpirches and so i dream of going back to   its when im weary of consideratio  and life is too much like a pathless oqg   where your face burns and tickles witpecobwebs broken across it and one eye is weepl from a twigs having lashed across it opel id like to get away from earth awhile and then come back to it and begin over may no fate willfully misunderstand me and half grant what i wish and snatch me away not to return earths the right place for love a  i dont know where its likely to go better  id like to go by climbing a birch tree and climb black branches up a snowwhite trunk  toward heaven till the tree could bear no more but dipped its top and set me down again that would be good both going and coming back one could do worse than be a swinger of birches    pea brush i walked down alone sunday after church to the place where john has been cutting trees to see for myself about the birch he said i could have to bush my peas the sun in the newcut narrow gap was hot enough for the first of may and stifling hot with the odor of sap from stumps still bleeding their life away the frogs that were peeping a thousand shrill wherever the ground was low and wet the minute they heard my step went still to watch me and see what i came to get birch boughs enough piled everywhere all fresh and sound from the recent ax time someone came with cart and pair and got them off the wild flowers backs they might be good for garden things to curl a little finger round the same as you seize catscradle strings and lift themselves up off the ground small good to anything growing wild they were crooking inany a trillium that had budded before the boughs were piled and since it was coming up had to come    putting in the seed you come to fetch me from my work tonight when suppers on the table and well see if i can leave off burying the white soft petals fallen from the apple tree soft petals yes but not so barren quite mingled with these smooth bean and wrinkled pea and go along with you ere you lose sight of what you came for and become like me slave to a springtime passion for the earth how love burns through the putting in the seed on through the watching for that early birth when just as the soil tarnishes with weed the sturdy seedling with arched body comes shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs    a time to talk when a friend calls to me from the road and slows his horse to a meaning walk i dont stand still and look around on all the hills i havent hoed and shout frem where i am what is it no not as there is a time to talk i thrust my hoe in the mellow ground bladeend up and five feet tall and plod i go up to the stone wall for a friendly visit    the cow in apple time something inspires the only cow of late to make no more of a wall than an open gate and think no more of wallbuilders than fools her face is flecked with pomace and she drools a cider syrup having tasted fruit she scorns a pasture withering to the root she runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten the windfalls spiked with stubble and wormeaten she leaves them bitten when she has to fiy she bellows on a knoll against the sky her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry j   an encounter once on the kind of day called weather breeder when the heat slowly hazes and the sun by its own power seems to be undone i was half boring through half climbing through a swamp of cedar choked with oil of cedar and scurf of plants and weary and overheated and sorry i ever left the road i knew i paused and rested on a sort of hook that had me by the coat as good as seated and since there was no other way to look looked up toward heaven and there against the blue stood over me a resurrected tree a tree that had been down and raised again a barkless specter he had halted too as if for fear of treading upon me i saw the strange position of his hands up at his shoulders dragging yellow strands of wire with something in it from men to men you here i said where arent you nowadays and whats the news you carryif you know and tell me where youre off formontreal me im not off for anywhere at all sometimes i wander out of beaten ways half looking for the orchid calypso    rangefinding the battle rent a cobweb diamondstrung and cut a flower beside a ground birds nest before it stained a single human breast the stricken flower bent double and so hung and still the bird revisited her young a butterfly its fall had dispossessed a moment sought in air his flower of rest then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung on the bare upland pasture there had spread oernight twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread and straining cables wet with silver dew a sudden passing bullet shook it dry the indwelling spider ran to greet the fly but finding nothing sullenly withdrew    the hill wife loneliness her word one ought not to have to care so much as you and i care when the birds come round the house to seem to say goodby or care so much when they come back with whatever it is they sing the truth being we are as much too glad for the one thing as we are too sad for the other here with birds that fill their breasts but with each other and themselves and their built or driven nests house fear alwaysi tell you this they learned always at night when they returned to the lonely house from far away to lamps unlighted and fire gone gray they learned to rattle the lock and key to give whatever might chance to be varning and time to be off in hight and preferring the out to the indoor night they learned to leave the housedoor wide until they had lit the lamp inside    the smile j her word i didnt like the way he went away that smile it never came of being gay still he smileddid you see himi was surel perhaps because we gave him only bread and the wretch knew from that that we were poor perhaps because he let us give instead of seizing from us as hemight have seized perhaps he mocked at us for being wed or being very young and he was pleased to have a vision of us old and dead i wonder how far down the road hes got hes watching from the woods as like as not the oftrepeated dream she had no saying dark enough for the dark pine that kept forever trying the windowlatch of the room where they slept the tireless but ineffectual hands that with every futile pass made the great tree seem as a little bird before the mystery of glassl it never had been inside the room and only one of the two was afraid in an oftrepeated dream of what the tree might do    the impulse it was too lonely for her there and too wild and since there were but two of them and no child and work was little in the house she was free and followed where he furrowed field or felled tree she rested on a log and tossed the fresh chips with a song only to herself on her lips and once she went to break a bough of black alder she strayed so far she scarcely heard when he called her and didnt answerdidnt speak or return she stood and then she ran and hid in the fern he never found her though he looked everywhere and he asked at her mothers house was she there sudden and swift and light as that the ties gave and he learned of finalities besides the grave    the bonfire oh lets go up the hill and scare ourselves as reckless as the best of them tonight by setting fire to all the brush we piled with pitchy hands to wait for rain or snow oh lets not wait for rain to make it safe the pile is ours we dragged it bough on bough down dark converging paths between the pines lets not care what we do with it tonight divide it no but bum it as one pile the way we piled it and lets be the talk of people brought to windows by a light thrown from somewhere against their wallpaper rouse them all both the free and not so free with saying what theyd like to do to us for what theyd better wait till we have done lets all but bring to life this old volcano if that is what the mountain ever was and scare ourselves let wild re loose we will    and scare you too the children said together why wouldnt it scare me to have a re begin in smudge with ropy smoke and know thai still if i repent i may recall it but in a moment not a little spurt of burning fatness and then nothing but the fire itself can put it out and that by burning out and before it burns out it will have roared first and mixed sparks with stars and sweeping round it with a flaming sword made the dim trees stand back in wider circle done so much and i know not how much more j    mean it shall not do if i can bind it well if it doesnt with its draft bring on a wind to blow in earnest from some quarter as once it did with me upon an april the breezes were so spent with winter blowing they seemed to fail the bluebirds under them short of the perch their languid bight was toward and my hame made a pinnacle to heaven as i walked once around it in possession but the wind out of doorsyou know the saying there came a gust you used to think the trees made wind by fanning since you never knew it blow but that you saw the trees in motion something or someone watching made that gust it put the harne tipdown and dabbed the grass of overwinter with the least tiptouch your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand the place it reached to blackened instantly the black was ahnost all there was by daylight that and the merest curl of cigarette smoke and a hame slender as the hepaticas bloodroot and violets so soon to be now but the black spread like black death on the ground and i think the sky darkened with a cloud like winter and evening coming on together there were enough things to be thought of then where the field stretches toward the north and settmg sun to hyla brook i gave it to hames without twice thinking where it verges upon the road to hames too though in fear they might find fuel there in withered brake grass its full length old silver goldenrod and alder and grape vine entanglement    to leap the dusty deadline for my own i took what front there was beside i knelt and thrust hands in and held my face away fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating a board is the best weapon if you have it i had my coat and oh i knew i knew and said out loud i couldnt bide the smother and heat so close in but the thought of all the woods and town on fire by me and all the town turned out to fight for methat held me  trusted the brook barrier but feared the road would fail and on that side the fire died not without a noise of crackling wood of something more than tindergrass and weed that brought me to my feet to hold it back by leaning back myself as if the reins were round my neck and i was at the plow i won but im sure no one ever spread another color over a tenth the space that i spread coalblack over in the time it took me neighbors coming home from town couldnt believe that so much black had come there while they had backs turned that it hadnt been there when they had passed an hour or so before going the other way and they not seen it they looked about for someone to have done it but there was no one i was somewhere wondering where all my weariness had gone and why i walked so light on air in heavy shoes in spite of a scorched fourthofjuly feeling why wouldnt i be scared remembering that if it scares you what will it do to us j   scare you but if you shrink from being scared what would you say to war if it should come thats what for reasons i should like to know if you can comfort me by any answer oh but wars not for childrenits for men now we are digging almost down to china my dears my dears you thought thatwe all thought it so your mistake was ours havent you heard though about the ships where war has found them out at sea about the towns where war has come through opening clouds at night with droning speed further erhead than all but stars and angels and children in the ships and in the towns havent you heard what we have lived to learn nothing so newsomething we had forgotten war is for everyone for children too i wasnt going to tell you and i mustnt the best way is to come up hill with me and have our fire and laugh and be afraid     a girls garden a neighbor of mine in the village likes to tell how one spring when she was a girl on the farm she did a childlike thing one day she asked her father to give her a garden plot to plant and tend and reap herself and he said why not in casting about for a corner he thought of an idle bit of walledoff ground where a shop had stood and he said just it and he said that ought to make you an ideal onegirl farm and give you a chance to put some strength on your slimjim arm it was not enough of a garden her father said to plow so she had to work it all by hand but she dont mind now she wheeled the dung in the wheelbarrow along a stretch of road but she always ran away and left her notnice load and hid from anyone passing and then she begged the seed    she says she thinks she planted one of all things but weed a hill each of potatoes radishes lettuce peas tomatoes beets beans pumpkins com and even fruit trees and yes she has long mistrusted that a cider apple tree in bearing there today is hers or at least may be her crop was a miscellany when all was said and done a little bit of everything a great deal of none now when she sees in the village how village things go just when it seems to come in right she says j know its as when i was a farmer oh never by way of advice and she never sins by telling the tale to the same person twice     locked out as told to a child when we locked up the house at night we always locked the flowers outside and cut them off from window light the time i dreamed the door was tried and brushed with buttons upon sleeves the flowers were out there with the thieves yet nobody molested them we did find one nasturtium upon the steps with bitten stem i may have been to blame for that i always thought it must have been some hower i played with as i sat at dusk to watch the moon down early    the last word of a bluebird as told to a child as i went out a crow in a low voice said oh i was looking for you how do you do i just came to tell you to tell lesley will you that her little bluebird wanted me to bring word that the north wind last night that made the stars bright and made ice on the trough almost made him cough his tail feathers off he just had to fiy but he sent her goodby and said to be good and wear her red hood and look for skunk tracks in the snow with an ax and do everything and perhaps in the spring he would come back and sing    outout the buzz saw snarled and rattled in the yard and made dust and dropped stovelength sticks of wood sweetscented stuff when the breeze drew across it and from there those that lifted eyes could count five mountain ranges one behind the other under the sunset far into vennont and the saw snarled and rattled snarled and rattled as it ran light or had to bear a load and nothing happened day was all but done call it a day i wish they might have said to please the boy by giving him the half hour that a boy counts so much when saved from work his sister stood beside them in her apron to tell them supper at the word the saw as if to prove saws knew what supper meant leaped out at the boys hand or seemed to leap he must have given the hand however it was neither refused the meeting but the hand the boys first outcry was a rueful laugh as he swung toward them holding up the hand half in appeal but half as if to keep the life from spilling then the boy saw all since he was old enough to know big boy doing a mans work though a child at heart he sawall spoiled dont let him cut my hand off the doctor when he comes dont let him sister so but the hand was gone already the doctor put him in the dark of ether he lay and puffed his lips out with his breath and thenthe watcher at his pulse took fright no one believed they listened at his heart     littleiessnothingand that ended it no more to build on there and they since they were not the one dead turned to their affairs    browns descent or the willynilly slide brown lived at such a lofty farm that everyone for miles could see his lantern when he did his chores in winter after halfpast three and many must have seen him make his wild descent from there one night cross lots cross walls cross everything describing rings of lantern light between the house and barn the gale got him by something he had on and blew him out on the icy crust that cased the world and he was gone walls were all buried trees were few he saw no stay unless he stove a hole in somewhere with his heel but though repeatedly he strove and stamped and said things to himself and sometimes something seemed to yield he gained no foothold but pursued his journey down from field to field sometimes he came with arms outspread like wings revolving in the scene upon his longer axis and with no small dignity of mien s   faster or slower as he chanced sitting or standing as he chose according as he feared to risk his neck or thought to spare his clothes he never let the lantern drop and some exclaimed who saw afar the figures he described with it i wonder what those signals are brown makes at such an hour of night hes celebrating something strange i wonder if hes sold his farm or been made master of the grange he reeled he lurched he bobbed he checked he fell and made the lantern rattle but saved the light from going out so halfway down he fought the battle incredulous of his own bad luck and then becoming reconciled to everything he gave it up and came down like a coasting child w ellibe that was all he said as standing in the river road he looked back up the slippery slope two miles it was to his abode sometimes as an authority on motorcars im asked if i should say our stock was petered out and this is my sincere reply    yankees are what they always were dont think brown ever gave up hope of getting home again because he couldnt climb that slippery slope or even thought of standing there until the january thaw should take the polish off the crust he bowed with grace to natural law and then went round it on his feet after the manner of our stock not much concerned for those to whom at that particular time oclock it must have looked as if the course he steered was really straight away from that which he was headed for not much concerned for them i say no more so than became a man and politician at odd seasons ive kept brown standing in the cold while i invested him with reasons but now he snapped his eyes three times then shook his lantern saying lies bout out and took the long way home by road a matter of several miles    the gumgatherer there overtook me and drew me in to his downhill earlymorning stride and set me five miles on my road better than if he had had me ride a man with a swinging bag for load and half the bag wound round his hand we talked like barking above the din of water we walked along beside and for my telling him where rd been and where i lived in mountain land to be coming home the way i was he told me a little about himself he came from higher up in the pass where the grist of the newbeginning brooks is blocks split off the mountain mass and hopeless grist enough it looks ever to grind to soil for grass the way it is will do for moss there he haj built his stolen shack it had to be a stolen shack because of the fears of fire and loss that trouble the sleep of lumber folk visions of half the world burned black and the sun shrunken yellow in smoke we know who when they come to town bring berries under the wagon seat or a basket of eggs between their feet what this man brought in a cotton sack was gum the gum of the mountain spruce he showed me lumps of the scented stuff like uncut jewels dull and rough    it comes to market golden brown but turns to pink between the teeth i told him this is a pleasant life to set your breast to the bark of trees that all your days are dim beneath and reaching up with a little knife to loose the resin and take it down and bring it to market when you please    the linegang here come the linegang pioneering by they throw a forest down less cut than broken they plant dead trees for living and the dead they string together with a living thread they string an instrument against the sky wherein words whether beaten out or spoken will run as hushed as when they were a thought but in no hush they string it they go past with shouts afar to pull the cable taut to hold it hard until they make it fast to ease awaythey have it with a laugh an oath of towns that set the wild at naught they bring the telephone and telegraph    the vanishing red he is said to have berm the last red man in acton and the iiller is said to have laughed if you like to call such a sound a laugh but he gave no one else a laughers license for he turned suddenly grave as if to say whose businessif i take it on myself whose businessbut why talk round the barn when its just that i hold with getting a thing done with you cant get back and see it as he saw it its too long a story to go into now youd have to have been there and lived it then you wouldnt have looked on it as just a matter of who began it between the two races some guttural exclamation of surprise the red man gave in poking about the mill over the great big thumping shuffling millstone disgusted the miller physically as coming from one who had no right to be heard from come john he said you want to see the wheelpit he took him down below a cramping rafter and showed him through a manhole in the hoor the water in desperate straits like frantic fish salmon and sturgeon lashing with their tails then he shut down the trap door with a ring in it that jangled even above the general noise and came upstairs aloneand gave that laugh and said something to a man with a mealsack that the man with the mealsack didnt catchthen oh yes he showed john the wheelpit all right j   the three stood listening to a fresh access of wind that caught against the house a moment gulped snow and then blew free againthe coles dressed but disheveled from some hours of sleep meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore meserve was first to speak he pointed backward over his shoulder with his pipestem saying you can just see it glancing off the roof making a great scroll upward toward the sky long enough for recording all our names on i think  just call up my wife and tell her im hereso farand starting on again ill call her softly so that if shes wise and gone to sleep she neednt wake to answer three times he barely stirred the bell then listened why lett still up lett im at coles im late i

the same i didnt call you to ask you to invite me home he lingered for some word she wouldnt say said it at last himself goodnight and then getting no answer closed the telephone snow    the three stood in the lamplight round the table with lowered eyes a moment till he said  just see how the horses are yes do both the coles said together mrs cole added you can judge better after seeing i want you here with me fred leave him here brother meserve you know to find your way out through the shed i guess i know my way i guess i know where i can find my name carved in the shed to tell me who i am

thats not sayinglook fred cole its twelve isnt it now hes been here half an hour he says he left the village store at nine three hours to do four milesa mile an hour or not much better why it doesnt seem as if a man could move that slow and move try to think what he did with all that time and three miles more to go dont let him go stick to him helen make him answer you that sort of man talks straight on all his life from the last thing he said himself stone deaf to anything anyone else may say i should have thought though you could make him hear you what is he doing out a night like this

house or shelter to put into from this place    to theirs im gomg to call his wife again wait and he may lets see wllat he will de lets see if he will think of her again but then i doubt hes thinking

getting up a miracle this minute privatelyto himself right now hes thinkift hell make a case of it if he succeeds but keep still if he fails keep still all over hell be deaddead and buried such a trouble not but ive every reason not to care what happens to him if it only takes some of the sanctimonious conceit out of one of those pious scalawags nonsense to that you want to see him safe you like the runt    dont you a little well i dont like what hes doing which is what you like and like him for oh yes you do you like your fun as well as anyone only you women have to put these airs on to impress men youve got us so ashamed of being men we cant look at a good fight between two boys and not feel bound to stop it let the man freeze an ear or two i say hes here i leave him all to you go in and save his lifeall right come in meserve sit down sit down how did you find the horses fine fine and ready for some more my wife here says it wont do youve got to give it up wont you to please me please if i say please mr meserve  leave it to your wife what did your wife say on the telephone meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp or something not far from it on the table by straightening out and lifting a forefinger he pointed with his hand from where it lay like a white crumpled spider on his knee that leaf there in your open book it moved just then i thought its stood erect like that j   there on the table ever since i came trying to tum itself backward or forward ive had my eye on it to make out which if forward then its with a friends impatience you see i knowto get you on to things it wants to see how you will take if backward its from regret for something you have passed and failed to see the good of never mind things must expect to come in front of us a many timesi dont say just how many that varies with the thingsbefore we see them one of the lies would make it out that nothing ever presents itself before us twice where would we be at last if that were so our very life depends on everythings recurring till we answer from within the thousandth time may prove the charmthat leaf it cant turn either way it needs the winds help but the wind didnt move it if it moved it moved itself the winds at naught in here it couldnt stir so sensitively poised a thing as that it couldnt reach the lamp to get a puff of black smoke from the flame or blow a rumple in the collies coat you make a little foursquare block of air quiet and light and warm in spite of all the illimitable dark and cold and storm and by so doing give these three lamp dog and bookleaf that keep near you their repose though for all anyone can tell repose may be the thing you havent yet you give it so false it is that what we havent we cant give so false that what we always say is true    ill have to tum the leaf if no one else will it wont lie down then let it stand who cares i shouldnt want to hurry you meserve but if youre goingsay youll stay you know but let me raise this curtain on a scene and show you how its piling up against you you see the snowwhite through the white of frost ask helen how far up the sash its climbed since last we read the gauge it looks as if some pallid thing had squashed its features hat and its eyes shut with overeagerness to see what people found so interesting in one another and had gone to sleep of its own stupid lack of understanding or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff short off and died against the windowpane brother meserve take care youll scare yourself more than you ill us with such nightmare talk its you it matters to because its you who have to go out into it alone let him talk helen and perhaps hell stay before you drop the curtainim reminded you recollect the boy who came out here to breathe the air one winterhad a room down at the averys well one sunny morning after a downy storm he passed our place and found me banking up the house with snow and i was burrowing in deep for warmth    piling it well above the windowsills the snow against the window caught his eye hey thats a pretty thoughtthose were his words so you can think its six feet deep outside while you sit warm and read up balanced rations you cant get too much winter in the winter those were his words and he went home and all but banked the daylight out of averys windows now you and i would go to no such length at the same time you cant deny it makes it not a mite worse sitting here we three playing our fancy to have the snowline run so high across the pane outside there where there is a sort of tunnel in the frost more like a tunnel than a holeway down at the far end of it you see a stir and quiver like the frayed edge of the drift blown in the wind i like thati like that well now i leave you people come meserve we thought you were deciding not to go the ways you found to say the praise of comfort and being where you are you want to stay ill own its cold for such a fall of snow this house is frozen brittle all except this room you sit in if you think the wind sounds further off its not because its dying youre further under in the snowthats all and feel it less hear the soft bombs of dust it bursts against us at the chimney mouth and at the eaves i like it from inside more than i shall out in it but the horses    are rested and its time to say goodnight and let you get to bed again goodnight sorry i had to break in on your sleep lucky for you you did lucky for you you had us for a halfway station to stop at if you were the kind of man paid heed to women youd take my advice and for your familys sake stay where you are but what good is my saying it over and over youve done more than you had a right to think you could donow you know the risk you take in going on our snowstorms as a rule arent looked on as mankillers and although id rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep under it all his door sealed up and lost than the man fighting it to keep above it yet think of the small birds at roost and not in nests shall i be counted less than they are their bulk in water would be frozen rock in no time out tonight and yet tomorrow they will come budding boughs from tree to tree flirting their wings and saying chickadee as if not knowing what you meant by the word storm but why when no one wants you to go on your wifeshe doesnt want you to we dont and you yourself dont want to who else is there save us from being cornered by a woman well theres she told fred afterward that in the pause right there she thought the dreaded word    was coming god but no he only said well theresthe storm that says i must go on that wants me as a war might if it came ask any man he threw her that as something to last her till he got outside the door he had cole with him to the bam to see him off when cole returned he found his wife still standing beside the table near the open book not reading it well what kind of a man do you call that she said he had the gift of words or is it tongues i ought to say was ever such a man for seeing likeness or disregarding peoples civil questions what weve found out in one hour more about him than we had seeing him pass by in the road a thousand times if tha the way he preachesl you didnt think youd keep him after all oh im not blaming you he didnt leave you much say in the matter and im just as glad were not in for a night of him no sleep if he had stayed the least thing set him going its quiet as an empty church without him but how much better off are we as it is well have to sit here till we know hes safe yes i suppose youll want to but i shouldnt    he knows what he can do or he wouldnt try get into bed i say and get some rest he wont come back and if he telephones it wont be for an hour or two well then we cant be any help by sitting here and living his fight through with him i suppose cole had been telephoning in the dark mrs coles voice came from an inner room did she call you or you call her she me youd better dress you wont go back to bed we must have been asleep its three and after had she been ringing long ill get my wrapper i want to speak to her all she said was he hadnt come and had he really started she knew he had poor thing two hours ago he had the shovel heli have made a fight why did i ever let him leave this house dont begin that you did the best you could to keep himthough perhaps you didnt quite conceal a wish to see him show the spunk to disobey you much his wife thank you    fred after all i said you shant make out that it was any way but what it was did she let on by any word she said she didnt thank me when i told her gone well then she said and well thenlike a threat and then her voice came scraping slow oh you why did you let him go asked why we let him you let me there ill ask her why she let him she didnt dare to speak when he was here their numberstwentyone the thing wont work someones receivers down the handle stumbles the stubborn thing the way it jars your arm its theirs shes dropped it from her hand and gone try speaking say hello what do you hear hello hello i hear an empty room you knowit sounds that way and yes i hear i think i hear a clockand windows rattling no step though if shes there shes sitting down shout she may hear you keep speaking then shouting is no good    hello hello hello you dont suppose she wouldnt go outdoors im half afraid thats just what she might do and leave the children wait and call again you cant hear whether she has left the door wide open and the winds blown out the lamp and the fires died and the rooms dark and cold one of two things either shes gone to bed or gone outdoors in which case both are lost do you know what shes like have you ever met her its strange she doesnt want to speak to us fred see if you can hear what i hear come a clock maybe not talking no dont you hear something else why yes i hearwhat is it what do you say it is a babys cryingl frantic it sounds though mufhed and far off    its mother wouicint let it cry like that not if shes there what do you make of it theres only one thing possible to make that is assumingthat she has gone out of course she hasnt though they both sat down helpless theres nothing we can do till morning fred i shant let you think of going out hold on the double bell began to chirp they started up fred took the telephone hello meserve youre there thenand your wife good why i askedshe didnt seem to answer he says she went to let him in the barn were glad oh say no more about it man drop in and see us when youre passing well she has him then though what she wants him for i dont see possibly not for herself maybe she only wants him for the children the whole todo seems to have been for nothing what spoiled our night was to him just his fun what did he come in forto talk and visit thought hed just call to tell us it was snowing if he thinks he is going to make our house a halfway coffee house twixt town and nowhere    i thought youd feel youd been too much concerned you think you havent been concerned yourself if you mean he was inconsiderate to rout us out to think for him at midnight and then take our advice no more than nothing why i agree with you but lets forgive him weve had a share in one night of his life whatll you bet he ever calls again    the sound of trees i wonder about the trees why do we wish to bear forever the noise of these more than another noise so close to our dwelling place we suffer them by the day till we lose all measure of pace and fixity in our joys and acquire a listening air they are that that talks of going but never gets away and that talks no less for knowing as it grows wiser and older that now it means to stay my feet tug at the hoar and my head sways to my shoulder sometimes when i watch trees sway from the window or the door i shall set forth for somewhere i shall make the reckless choice some day when they are in voice and tossing so as to scare the white clouds over them on i shall have less to say but i shall be gone j   new hampshire   new hampshire i met a lady from the south who said you wont believe she said it but she said it none of my family ever worked or had a thing to sell i dont suppose the work much matters you may work for all of me ive seen the time ive had to work myself the having anything to sell is what is the disgrace in man or state or nation i met a traveler from arkansas who boasted of his state as beautiful for diamonds and apples diamonds and apples in commercial quantities i asked him on my guard oh yes he answered off his the time was evening in the pullman i see the porters made your bed i told him i met a californian who would talk californiaa state so blessed he said in climate none had ever died there a natural death and vigilance committees had had to organize to stock the graveyards and vindicate the states humanity just the way stefansson runs on i murmured about the british arctic thats what comes of being in the market with a climate i met a poet from another state a zealot full of fluid inspiration who in the name of fluid inspiration but in the best style of bad salesmanship   angrily tried to make me write a protest in verse i think against the volstead act he didnt even offer me a drink until i asked for one to steady him this is called having an idea to sell it never could have happened in new hampshire the only person really soiled with trade i ever stumbled on in old new hampshire was someone who had just come back ashamed from selling things in california hed built a noble mansard roof with balls on turrets like constantinople deep in woods some ten miles from a railroad station as if to put forever out of mind the hope of being as we say received i found him standing at the close of day inside the threshold of his open bam like a lone actor on a gloomy stage and recognized him through the iron gray in which his face was mufhed to the eyes as an old boyhood friend and once indeed a drover with me on the road to brighton his farm was grounds and not a farm at all his house among the local sheds and shanties rose like a factors at a trading station and he was rich and i was still a rascal i couldnt keep from asking impolitely where had he been and what had he been doing how did he get so rich was understood in dealing in old rags in san francisco oh it was terrible as well could be we both of us turned over in our graves      just specimens is all new hampshire has one each of everything as in a showcase which naturally she doesnt care to sell she had one president pronounce him purse and make the most of it for better or worse hes your one chance to score against the state she had one daniel webster he was all the daniel webster ever was or shall be she had the dartmouth needed to produce him i call her old she has one family whose claim is good to being settled here before the era of colonization and before that of exploration even john smith remarked them as he coasted by dangling their legs and fishing off a wharf at the isles of shoals and satisfied himself they werent red indians but veritable preprimitives of the white race dawn people like those who furnished adams sons with wives however uninnocent they may have been in being there so early in our history theyd been there then a hundred years or more pity he didnt ask what they were up to at that date with a wharf already built and take their name theyve since told me their name today an honored one in nottingham as for what they were up to more than fishing suppose they werent behaving puritanly the hour had not yet struck for being good mankind had not yet gone on the sabbatical it became an explorer of the deep not to explore too deep in others business    did you but mow of him  hampshire has one real reformer who wouja change the world so it would be accepted by two classes artists the minute they set up as artists before that is they are themselves accepted and boys the minute they get out of college i cant help thinking those are tests to go by and she has one i dont know what to call him who comes from philadelphia every year with a great flock of chickens of rare breeds he wants to give the educational advantages of growing almost wild under the watchful eye of hawk and eagle dorkings because theyre spoken of by chaucer sussex because theyre spoken of by herrick she has a touch of gold new hampshire gold you may have heard of it i had a farm offered me not long since up berlin way with a mine on it that was worked for gold but not gold in commercial quantities just enough gold to make the engagement rings and marriage rings of those who owned the farm what gold more innocent could one have asked for one of my children ranging after rocks lately brought home from andover or canaan a specimen of beryl with a trace of radium i know with radium the trace would have to be the merest trace to be below the threshold of commercial but trust new hampshire not to have enough of radium or anything to sell    a specimen of everything i said she has one witchold style she lives in colebrook the only other witch i ever met was lately at a cutglass dinner in boston there were four candles and four people present the witch was young and beautiful new style and openminded she was free to question her gift for reading letters locked in boxes why was it so much greater when the boxes were metal than it was when they were wooden it made the world seem so mysterious the sciety for psychical research was cognizant her husband was worth millions i think he owned some shares in harvard college new hampshire used to have at salem a company we called the white corpuscles whose duty was at any hour of night to rush in sheets and fools caps where they smelled a thing the least bit doubtfully perscented and give someone the skipper iresons ride one each of everything as in a showcase more than enough land for a specimen youll say she has but there there enters in something else to protect her from herself there quality makes up for quantity not even new hampshire farms are much for sale the farm i made my home on in the mountains i had to take by force rather than buy i caught the owner outdoors by himself raking up after winter and i said im going to put you off this fann i want it where are vou going to put me in the road     im going to put you oil the fann next to it why wont the farm next to it do for you i like this better it was really better apples new hampshire has them but unsprayed with no suspicion in stemend or blossomend of vitriol or arsenate of lead and so not good for anything but cider her unpruned grapes are flung like lariats far up the birches out of reach of man a state producing precious metals stones andwriting none of these except perhaps the precious literature in quantity or quality to worry the producer about disposing of it do you know considering the market there are more poems produced than any other thing no wonder poets sometimes have to seem so much more businesslike than business men their wares are so much harder to get rid of shes one of the two best states in the union vennonts the other and the two have been yokefellows in the sapyoke from of old in many marches and they lie like wedges thick end to thin end and thin end to thick end and are a figure of the way the strong of mind and strong of arm should fit together one thick where one is thin and vice versa new hampshire raises the connecticut in a trout hatchery near canada but soon divides the river with vennont    both are delightful states for their absurdly small townslost nation bungey muddy boo poplin still comers so called not because the place is silent all day long nor yet because it boasts a whisky stillbecause it set out once to be a city and still is only comers crossroads in a wood and i remember one whose name appeared between the pictures on a movie screen election night once in franconia when everything had gone republican and democrats were sore in need of comfort easton goes democratic wilson  hughes  and everybody to the saddest laughed the loud laugh the big laugh at the little new york five million laughs at manchester manchester sixty or seventy thousand laughs at littleton four thousand littleton laughs at franconia seven hundred and franconia laughs i feardid laugh that night at easton what has easton left to laugh at and like the actress exclaim oh my god at theres bungey and for bungey there are towns whole townships named but without population anything i can say about new hampshire will serve almost as well about vermont excepting that they differ in their mountains the vermont mountains stretch extended straight new hampshire mountains curl up in a coil i had been coming to new hampshire mountains and here i am and what am i to say    here first my theme becomes embarrassing emerson said the god who made new hampshire taunted the lofty land with little men another massachusetts poet said i go no more to summer in new hampshire ive given up my summer place in dublin but when i asked to know what ailed new hampshire she said she couldnt stand the people in it the little men its massachusetts speaking and when i asked to know what ailed the people she said go read your own books and find out i may as well confess myself the author of several books against the world in general to take them as against a special state or even nations to restrict my meaning im what is called a sensibilitist or otherwise an environmentalist i refuse to adapt myself a mite to any change from hot to cold from wet to dry from poor to rich or back again i make a virtue of my suffering from nearly everything that goes on round me in other words i know wherever i am being the creature of literature i am i shall not lack for pain to keep me awake kit marlowe taught me how to say my prayers why this is hell nor am lout of it samoa russia ireland i complain of no less than england france and italy because i wrote my novels in new hampshire is no proof that i aimed them at new hampshire when i left massachusetts years ago     between two days the reason why i sought new hampshire not connecticut rhode island new york or vermont was this where i was living then new hampshire offered the nearest boundary to escape across i hadnt an illusion in my handbag about the people being better there than those i left behind i thought they werent i thought they couldnt be and yet they were d sure had no such friends in massachusetts as hall of windham gay of atkinson bartlett of raymond now of colorado harris of derry and lynch of bethlehem the glorious bards of massachusetts seem to want to make new hampshire people over they taunt the lofty land with little men i dont know what to say about the people for arts sake one could almost wish them worse rather than better how are we to write the russian novel in america as long as life goes so unterribly there is the pinch from which our only outcry in literature to date is heard to come we get what little misery we can out of not having cause for misery it makes the guild of novel writers sick to be expected to be dostoievskis on nothing worse than too much luck and comfort this is not sorrow though its just the vapors and recognized as such in russia itself under the new regime and so forbidden if well it is with russia then feel free    to say so or be stood against the wall and shot its pollyanna now or death this then is the new freedom we hear tell of and very sensible no state can build a literature that shall at once be sound and sad on a foundation of wellbeing to show the level of intelligence among us it was just a warren farmer whose horse had pulled him short up in the road by me a stranger this is what he said from nothing but embarrassment and want of anything more sociable to say you hear those hounddogs sing on moosilauke well they remind me of the hue and cry weve heard against the midvictorians and never rightly understood till bryan retired from politics and joined the chorus the matter with the midvictorians seems to have been a man named john l darwin go long i said to him he to his horse i knew a man who failing as a farmer burned down his farmhouse for the fire insurance and spent the proceeds on a telescope to satisfy a lifelong curiosity about our place among the infinities and how was that for otherworldliness if i must choose which i would elevate the people or the already lofty mountains fd elevate the already lofty mountaills the only fault i find with old new hampshire is that her mountains arent quite high enough     i was not always so ive come to be so how to my sorrow how have i attained a height from which to look down critical on mountains what has given me assurance to say what height becomes new hampshire mountains or any mountains can it be some strength i feel as of an earthquake in my back to heave them higher to the morning star can it be foreign travel in the alps or having seen and credited a moment the solid molding of vast peaks of cloud behind the pitiful reality of lincoln lafayette and liberty or some such sense as says how high shall jet the fountain in proportion to the basin no none of these has raised me to my throne of intellectual dissatisfaction but the sad accident of having seen our actual mountains given in a map of early times as twice the height they are ten thousand feet instead of only five which shows how sad an accident may be five thousand is no longer high enough whereas i never had a good idea about improving people in the world here i am overfertile in suggestion and cannot rest from planning day or night how high id thrust the peaks in summer snow to tap the upper sky and draw a flow of frosty night air on the vale below down from the stars to freeze the dew as stany the more the sensibilitist i am    the more i seem to want my mountains wild the way the wiry gangboss liked the logjam after hed picked the lock and got it started he dodged a log that lifted like an arm against the sky to break his back for him then came in dancing skipping with his life across the roar and chaos and the words we saw him say along the zigzag journey were doubtless as the words we heard him say on coming nearer wasnt she an ideal sonofabitch you bet she was an ideal for all her mountains fall a little short her people not quite short enough for art shes still new hampshire a most restful state lately in converse with anew york alec about the new school of the pseudophallic i found myself in a close comer where i had to make an ahnost funny choice choose you which you will bea prude or puke mewling and puking in the public arms me for the hills where i dont have to choose but jf you had to choose which would you be i wouldnt be a prude afraid of nature i know a man who took a double ax and went alone against a grove of trees but his heart failing him he dropped the ax and ran for shelter quoting matthew arnold cnature is cruel man is sick of blood theres been enough shed without shedding mine remember birnam wood the woods in flux he had a special terror of the flux    that showed itself in dendrophobia the only decent tree had been to mill and educated into boards he said he knew too well for any earthly use the line where man leaves off and nature starts and never overstepped it save in dreams he stood on the safe side of the line talking which is sheer matthew amoldism the cult of one who owned himself a foiled circuitous wanderer and took dejectedly his seat upon the intellectual throne agreed in frowning on these improvised altars the woods are full of nowadays again as in the days when ahaz sinned by worship under green trees in the open scarcely a mile but that i come on one a blackcheeked stone and stick of rainwashed charcoal even to say the groves were gods first temples comes too near to ahaz sin for safety nothing not built with hands of course is sacred but here is not a question of whats sacred rather of what to face or run away from id hate to be a runaway from nature and neither would i choose to be a puke who cares not what he does in company and when he cant do anything falls back on words and tries his worst to make words speak louder than actions and sometimes achieves it it seems a narrow choice the age insists on how about being a good greek for instance that course they tell me isnt offered this year come but this isnt choosingpuke or prude well if i have to choose one or the other    i choose to be a plain new hampshire farmer with an income in cash of say a thousand from say a publisher in new york city its restful to arrive at a decision and restful just to think about new hampshire at present i am living in vermont    a star in a stoneboat for lincoln macveagh never tell me that not one star of all that slip from heaven at night and softly fall has been picked up with stones to build a wall some laborer found one faded and stone cold and saving that its weight suggested gold and tugged it from his first too certain hold he noticed nothing in it to remark he was not used to handling stars thrown dark and lifeless from an interrupted arc he did not recognize in that smooth coal the one thing palpable beside the soul to penetrate the air in which we roll he did not see how like a flying thing it brooded anteggs and had one large wing one not so large for flying in a ring and a long bird of paradises tail though these when not in use to fly and trail it drew back in its body like a snail nor know that he might move it from the spot the harm was done from having been starshot the very nature of the soil was hot and burning to yield flowers instead of grain flowers fanned and not put out by all the rain poured on them by his prayers prayed in vain    he moved it roughly with an iron bar he loaded an old stoneboat with the star and not as you might think a hying car such as even poets would admit perforce more practical than pegasus the horse if it could put a star back in its course he dragged it through the plowed ground at a pace but faintly reminiscent of the race of jostling rock in interstellar space it went for building stone and i as though commanded in a dream forever go to right the wrong that this should have been so yet ask where else it could have gone as well i do not knowi cannot stop to tell he might have left it lying where it fell from following walls i never lift my eye except at night to places in the sky where showers of charted meteors let hy some may know what they seek in school and church and why they seek it there for what i search i must go measuring stone walls perch on perch sure that though not a star of death and birth so not to be compared perhaps in worth to such resorts of life as mars and earth    though not i say a star of deah and sin it yet has poles ad only eeds a spin to show its wcrldly juture and begin to chafe and shuffie in my cauoused palm and run off in strange tangents with my arm as fish do with the line in first alarm such as it is it promises the prize of the one world complete in any size that i am like to compass fool or wise    the censustaker i came an errand one cloudblowing evening to a slabbuilt blackpapercovered house of one room and one window and one door the only dwelling in a waste cut over a hundred square miles round it in the mountains and that not dwelt in now by men or women it never had been dwelt in though by women so what is this i make a sorrow of i came as censustaker to the waste to count the people in it and found none none in the hundred miles none in the house where i came last with some hope but not much mter hours overlooking from the cliffs an emptiness hayed to the very stone i found no people that dared show themselves none not in hiding from the outward eye the time was autumn but how anyone could tell the time of year when every tree that could have dropped a leaf was down itself and nothing but the stump of it was left now bringing out its rings in sugar of pitch and every tree up stood a rotting trunk without a single leaf to spend on autumn or branch to whistle after what was spent perhaps the wind the more without the help of breathing trees said something of the time of year or day the way it swung a door forever off the latch as if rude men passed in and slammed it shut each one behind him for the next one to open for himself i counted nine i had no right to count j   but this was dreamy unofficial counting before i made the tenth across the threshold where was my supper where was anyones no lamp was lit nothing was on the table the stove was coldthe stove was off the chimney and down by one side where it lacked a leg the people that had loudly passed the door were people to the ear but not the eye they were not on the table with their elbows they were not sleeping in the shelves of bunks i saw no men there and no bones of men there i armed myself against such bones as might be with the pitchblackened stub of an axhandle i picked up off the strawdust covered hoor not bones but the illfitted window rattled the door was still because i held it shut while i thought what to do that could be done about the houseabout the people not there this house in one year fallen to decay filled me with no less sorrow than the houses fallen to ruin in ten thousand years where asia wedges africa from europe nothing was left to do that i could see unless to find that there was no one there and declare to the cliffs too far for echo the place is desert and let whoso lurks in silence if in this he is aggrieved break silence now or be forever silent let him say why it should not be declared so the melancholy of having to count souls where they grow fewer and fewer every year is extreme where they shrink to none at all it must be i want life to go on living    the starsplitter you know orion always comes up sideways throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains and rising on his hands he looks in on me busy outdoors by lanternlight with something i should have done by daylight and indeed after the ground is frozen i should have done before it froze and a gust flings a handful of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney to make fun of my way of doing things or else fun of orions having caught me has a man i should like to ask no rights these forces are obliged to pay respect to so brad mclaughlin mingled reckless talk of heavenly stars with huggermugger farming till having failed at huggermugger farming he burned his house down for the fire insurance and spent the proceeds on a telescope to satisfy a lifelong curiosity about our place among the infinities what do you want with one of those blame things i asked him well beforehand dont you get onel dont call it blamed there isnt anything more blameless in the sense of being less a weapon in our human fight he said ill have one if i sell my farm to buy it there where he moved the rocks to plow the ground and plowed between the rocks he couldnt move few farms changed hands so rather than spend years trying to sell his farm and then not selling he burned his house down for the fire insurance    and bought the telescope with what it came to he had been heard to say by several the best thing that were put here fors to see the strongest thing thats given us to see withs a telescope someone in every town seems to me owes it to the town to keep one in littleton it may as well be me after such loose talk it was no surprise when he did what he did and burned his house down mean laughter went about the town that day to let him mow we werent the least imposed on and he could waitwed see to him tomorrow but the first thing next morning we reflected if one by one we counted people out for the least sin it wouldnt take us long to get so we had no one left to live with for to be social is to be forgiving our thief the one who does our stealing from us we dont cut off from coming to church suppers but what we miss we go to him and ask for he promptly gives it back that is if still uneaten unworn out or undisposed of it wouldnt do to be too hard on brad about his telescope beyond the age of being given one for christmas gift he had to take the best way he mew how to find himself in one well all we said was he took a strange thing to be roguish over some sympathy was wasted on the house a good oldtimer dating back along but a house isnt sentient the house didnt feel anything and if it did    why not regard it as a sacrifice and an oldfashioned sacrifice by fire instead of a newfashioned one at auction out of a house and so out of a farm at one stroke of a match brad had to turn to earn a living on the concord railroad as underticketagent at a station where his job when he wasnt selling tickets was setting out up track and down not plants as on a farm but planets evening stars that varied in their hue from red to green he got a good glass for six hundred dollars his new job gave him leisure for stargazing often he bid me come and have a look up the brass barrel velvet black inside at a star quaking in the other end i recollect a night of broken clouds and underfoot snow melted down to ice and melting further in the wind to mud bradford and i had out the telescope we spread our two legs as we spread its three pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it and standing at our leisure till the day broke said some of the best things we ever said that telescope was christened the starsplitter because it didnt do a thing but split a star in two or three the way you split a globule of quicksilver in your hand with one stroke of your finger in the middle its a starsplitter if there ever was one and ought to do some good if splitting stars sa thing to be compared with splitting wood    weve looked and looked but after all where are we do we know any better where we are and how it stands between the night tonight and a man with a smoky lantern chimney how different from the way it ever stood   maple her teachers certainty it must be mabel made maple first take notice of her name she asked her father and he told her maple maple is right but teacher told the school theres no such name teachers dont know as much as fathers about children you tell teacher you tell her that its maple you ask her if she knows a maple tree well you were named after a maple tree your mother named you you and she just saw each other in passing in the room upstairs one coming this way into life and one going the other out of lifeyou know so you cant have much recollection of her she had been having a long look at you she put her finger in your cheek so hard it must have made your dimple there and said maple i said it too yes for her name she nodded so were sure theres no mistake i dont know what she wanted it to mean but it seems like some word she left to bid you be a good girlbe like a maple tree how like a maple trees for us to guess or for a little girl to guess sometime not nowat least i shouldnt try too hard now by and by i will tell you all i know about the different trees and something too    about your mother that perhaps may help dangerous selfarousing words to sow luckily all she wanted of her name then was to rebuke her teacher with it next day and give the teacher a scare as from her father anything further had been wasted on her or so he tried to think to avoid blame she would forget it she all but forgot it what he sowed with her slept so long a sleep and came so near death in the dark of years that when it woke and came to life again the flower was different from the parent seed it came back vaguely at the glass one day as she stood saying her name over aloud striking it gently across her lowered eyes to make it go well with the way she looked what was it about her name its strangeness lay in having too much meaning other names as lesley carol irma marjorie signified nothing rose could have a meaning but hadnt as it went she knew a rose this difference from other names it was made people notice itand notice her they either noticed it or got it wrong her problem was to find out what it asked in dress or manner of the girl who bore it if she could form some notion of her mother what she had thought was lovely and what good this was her mothers childhood home the house one story high in front three stories on the end it presented to the road the arrangement made a pleasant sunny cellar her mothers bedroom was her fathers yet j   where she could watch her mothers picture fading once she found for a bookmark in the bible a maple leaf she thought must have been laid in wait for her there she read every word of the two pages it was pressed between as if it was her mother speaking to her but forgot to put the leaf back in closing and lost the place never to read again she was sure though there had been nothing in it so she looked for herself as everyone looks for himself more or less outwardly and her selfseeking fitful though it was may still have been what led her on to read and think a little and get some city schooling she learned shorthand whatever shorthand may have had to do with itshe sometimes wondered so till she found herself in a strange place for the name maple to have brought her to taking dictation on a paper pad and in the pauses when she raised her eyes watching out of a nineteenth story window an airship laboring with unshiplike motion and a vague alldisturbing roar above the river beyond the highest city built with hands someone was saying in such natural tones she almost wrote the words down on her knee do you know you remind me of a tree a maple tree  because my name is maple snt it mabel i thought it was mabel    no doubt youve heard the office call me mabel i have to let them call me what they like they were both stirred that he should have divined without the name her personal mystery it made it seem as if there must be something she must have missed herself so they were married and took the fancy home with them to live by they went on pilgrimage once to her fathers the house one story high in front three stories on the side it presented to the road to see if there was not some special tree she might have overlooked they could find none not so much as a single tree for shade let alone grove of trees for sugar orchard she told him of the bookmark maple leaf in the big bible and all she remembered of the place marked with itwave offering something about wave offering it said t ouve never asked your father outright have youp i have and been put off sometime i think this was her faded memory of the way once long ago her father had put himself off because no telling but it may have been something between your father and your mother not meant for us at all not meant for me where would the fairness be in giving me    a name to carry for life and never know the secret ow and then it may have been something a father couldnt tell a daughter as well as could a mother and again it may have been their one lapse into fancy twould be too bad to make him sorry for by bringing it up to him when he was too old your father feels us round him with our questing and holds us off unnecessarily as if he didnt know what little thing might lead us on to a discovery it was as personal as he could be about the way he saw it was with you to say your mother had she lived would be as far again as from being born to bearing just one look more with what you say in mind and i give up which last look came to nothing but though they now gave up the search forever they clung to what one had seen in the other by inspiration it proved there was something they kept their thoughts away from when the maples stood uniform in buckets and the steam of sap and snow rolled off the sugar house when they made her related to the maples it was the tree the autumn fire ran through and swept of leathern leaves but left the bark unscorched unblackened even by any smoke they always took their holidays in autumn once they came on a maple in a glade standing alone with smooth arms lifted up     and every leaf of foliage shed worn laid scarlet and pale pink about her feet but its age kept them from considering this one twentyfive years ago at maples naming it hardly could have been a twoleaved seedling the next cow might have licked up out at pasture could it have been another maple like it they hovered for a moment near discovery figurative enough to see the symbol but lacking faith in anything to mean the same at different times to different people perhaps a filial diffidence partly kept them from thinking it could be a thing so bridal and anyway it came too late for maple she used her hands to cover up her eyes we would not see the secret if we could now we are not looking for it any more thus had a name with meaning given in death made a girls marriage and ruled in her life no matter that the meaning was not clear a name with meaning could bring up a child taking the child out of the parents hands better a meaningless name i should say as leaving more to nature and happy chance name children some names and see what you do    the axhelve ive known ere now an interfering branch of alder catch my lifted ax behind me but that was in the woods to hold my hand from striking at anuther alders roots and that was as i say an alder branch this was a man baptiste who stole one day behind me on the snow in my own yard where i was working at the choppingblock and cutting nothing not cut down already he caught my ax expertly on the rise when all my strength put forth was in his favor held it a moment where it was to calm me then took it from meand i let him take it i didnt know him well enough to know what it was all about there might be something he had in mind to say to a bad neighbor he might prefer to say o him disanned but all he had to tell me in frenchenglish was what he thought ofnot me but my ax me only as i took my ax to heart it was the bad axhelve someone had sold me made on machine he said plowing the grain with a thick thumbnail to show how it ran across the handles long drawn serpentine like the two strokes across a dollar sign you give her one good crack shes snap raght off den wheres your haxead eying frough de hair admitted and yet what was that to him come on my house and i put you one in whats las awhilegood hickry whats grow crooked    de second growt i cut myselftough tough something to sell that wasnt how it sounded den when you say you come its cost you nothing tonaght as well tonight as any night beyond an overwarmth of kitchen stove my welcome differed from no other welcome baptiste knew best why i was where i was so long as he would leave enough unsaid i shouldnt mind his being overjoyed if overjoyed he was at having got me where i must judge if what he knew about an ax that not everybody else knew was to count for nothing in the measure of a neighbor hard if though cast away for life with yankees a frenchman couldnt get his human rating mrs baptiste came in and rocked a chair that had as many motions as the world one back and forward in and out of shadow that got her nowhere one more gradual sideways that would have run her on the stove in time had she not realized her danger and caught herself up bodily chair and all and set herself back where she started from she aint spick too much henglishdats too bad i was afraid in brightening first on me then on baptiste as if she understood    vhat passed between us she was only feigning baptiste was anxious for her but no more than for himself so placed he couldnt hope to keep his bargain of the morning with me in time to keep me from suspecting him of really never having meant to keep it needlessly soon he had his axhelves out a quiverful to choose from since he wished me to have the best he had or had to spare not for me to ask which when what he took had beauties he had to point me out at length to insure their not being wasted on me he liked to have it slender as a whipstock free from the least knot equal to the strain of bending like a sword across the knee he showed me that the lines of a good helve were native to the grain before the knife expressed them and its curves were no false curves put on it from without and there its strength lay for the hard work he chafed its long white body from end to end with his rough hand shut round it he tried it at the eyehole in the axhead hahn hahn he mused dont need much taking down baptiste knew how to make a short job long for love of it and yet not waste time either do you know what we talked about was knowledge baptiste on his defense about the children he kept from school or did his best to keep whatever school and children and our doubts of laidon education had to do with the curves of his axhelves and his having    used these unscrupulously to bring me to see for once the inside of his house was i desired in friendship partly as someone to leave it to whether the right to hold such doubts of education should depend upon the education of those who held them but now he brushed the shavings from his lmee and stood the ax there on its horses hoof erect but not without its waves as when the snake stood up for evil in the garden topheavy with a heaviness his short thick hand made light of steelblue chin drawn down and in a littlea french touch in that baptiste drew back and squinted at it pleased see how shes cock her head     the grindstone having a wheel and four legs of its own has never availed the cumbersome grindstone to get it anywhere that i can see these hands have heped it go and even race not all the motion though they ever lent not all the miles it may have thought it went have got it one step from the starting place it stands beside the same old apple tree the shadow of the apple tree is thin upon it now its feet are fast in snow all other farm machinerys gone in and some of it on no more legs and wheel than the grindstone can boast to stand or go illl thinking chiefly of the wheelbarrow for months it hasnt known the taste of steel washed down with rusty water in a tin but standing outdoors hungry in the cold except in towns at night is not a sin and anyway its standing in the yard under a ruinous live apple tree has nothing any more to do with me except that i remember how of old one summer day all day i drove it hard and someone mounted on it rode it hard and he and i between us ground a blade i gave it the preliminary spin and poured on water tears it might have been and when it almost gaily jumped and flowed a fathertimelike man got on and rode armed with a scythe and spectacles that glowed    he turned on willpower to increase the load and slow me downand i abruptly slowed like coming to a sudden railroad station i changed from hand to hand in desperation i wondered what machine of ages gone this represented an improvement on for all i knew it may have sharpened spears and arrowheads itself much use for years had gradually worn it an oblate spheroid that kicked and struggled in its gait appearing to return me hate for hate but i forgive it now as easily as any other boyhood enemy whose pride has failed to get him anywhere i wondered who it was the man thought ground the one who held the wheel back or the one who gave his life to keep it going round i wondered if he really thought it fair for him to have the say when we were done such were the bitter thoughts to which i turned not for myself was i so much concerned oh notalthough of course i could have found a better way to pass the afternoon than grinding discord out of a grindstone and beating insects at their gritty tune nor was i for the man so much concerned once when the grindstone almost jumped its bearing it looked as if he might be badly thrown and wounded on his blade so far from caring i laughed inside and only cranked the faster it ran as if it wasnt greased but glued id welcome any moderate disaster    that might be calculated to postpone what evidently nothing could conclude the thing that made me more and more afraid was that wed ground it sharp and hadnt known and now were only wasting precious blade and when he raised it dripping once and tried the creepy edge of it with wary touch and viewed it over his glasses funnyeyed only disinterestedly to decide it needed a turn more i could have cried wasnt there danger of a turn too much mightnt we make it worse instead of better i was for leaving something to the whetter what if t wasnt all it should be id be satisfied if hed be satisfied    pauls wife to drive paul out of any lumber camp all that was needed was to say to him how is the wife pauland hed disappear some said it was because he had no wife and hated to be twitted on the subject others because hed come within a day or so of having one and then been jilted others because hed had one once a good one whod run away with someone else and left him and others still because he had one now he only had to be reminded of he was all duty to her in a minute he had to run right off to look her up as if to say thats so how is my wife i hope she isnt getting into mischief no one was anxious to get rid of paul hed been the hero of the mountain camps ever since just to show them he had slipped the bark of a whole tamarack off whole as clean as boys do off a willow twig to make a willow whistle on a sunday in april by subsiding meadow brooks they seemed to ask him just to see him go how is the wife paul and he always went he never stopped to murder anyone who asked the question he just disappeared nobody knew in what direction although it wasnt usually lorg before they heard of him in some new camp the same paul at the same old feats of logging the question everywhere was why should paul    object to being asked a civil question a man you could say almost anything to short of a fighting word you have the answers and there was one more not so fair to paul that paul had married a wife not his equal paul was ashamed of her to match a hero she would have had to be a heroine instead of which she was some halfbreed squaw but if the story murphy told was true she wasnt anything to be ashamed of you know paul could do wonders everyones heard how he thrashed the horses on a load that wouldnt budge until they simply stretched their rawhide harness from the load to camp paul told the boss the load would be all right the sun will bring your load inand it did by shrinking the rawhide to natural length thats what is called a stretcher but i guess the one about his jumping sos to land with both his feet at once against the ceiling and then land safely right side up again back on the hoor is fact or pretty near fact well this is such a yarn paul sawed his wife out of a whitepine log murphy was there and as you might say saw the lady born paul worked at anything in lumbering hed been hard at it taking boards away fori forgetthe last ambitious sawyer to want to find out if he couldnt pile the lumber on paul till paul begged for mercy theyd sliced the first slab off a big butt log and the sawyer had slammed the carriage back    to slam end on again against the saw teeth to judge them by the way they caught themselves when they saw what had happened to the log they must have had a guilty expectation something was going to go with their slambanging something had left a broad black streak of grease on the new wood the whole length of the log except perhaps a foot at either end but when paul put his finger in the grease it wasnt grease at all but a long slot the log was hollow they were sawing pine first time i ever saw a hollow pine that comes of having paul around the place take it to hell for me the sawyer said everyone had to have a look at it and tell paul what he ought to do about it they treated it as his you take a jackknife and spread the opening and youve got a dugout all dug to go afishing in to paul the hollow looked too sound and clean and empty ever to have housed birds or beasts or bees there was no entrance for them to get in by it looked to him like some new kind of hollow he thought hed better take his jackknife to so after work that evening he came back and let enough light into it by cutting to see if it was empty he made out in there a slender length of pith or was it pith it might have been the skin a snake had cast and left stood up on end inside the tree the hundred years the tree must have been growing more cutting and he had this in both hands and looking from it to the pond nearby    paul wondered how it would respond to water not a breeze stirred but just the breath of air he made in walking slowly to the beach blew it once off his hands and ahnost broke it he laid it at the edge where it could drink at the first drink it rustled and grew limp at the next drink it grew invisible paul dragged the shallows for it with his fingers and thought it must have melted it was gone and then beyond the open water dim with midges where the log drive lay pressed against the boom it slowly rose a person rose a girl her wet hair heavy on her like a helmet who leaning on a log looked back at paul and that made paul in turn look back to see if it was anyone behind him that she was looking at instead of him murphy had been there watching all the time but from a shed where neither of them could see him there was a moment of suspense in birth when the girl seemed too waterlogged to live before she caught her first breath with a gasp and laughed then she climbed slowly to her feet and walked off talking to herself or paul across the logs like backs of alligators paul taking after her around the pond next evening murphy and some other fellows got drunk and tracked the pair up catamount from the bare top of which there is a view to other hills across a kettle valley and there well after dark let murphy tell it they saw paul and his creature keeping house    it was the only glimpse that anyone has had of paul and her since murphy saw them falling in love across the twilight millpond more than a mile across the wilderness they sat together halfway up a cliff in a small niche let into it the girl brightly as if a star played on the place paul darkly like her shadow all the light was from the girl herself though not from a star as was apparent from what happened next all those great ruffians put their throats together and let out a loud yell and threw a bottle as a brute tribute of respect to beauty of course the bottle fell short by a mile but the shout reached the girl and put her light out she went out like a firefly and that was all so there were witnesses that paul was married and not to anyone to be ashamed of everyone had been wrong in judging paul murphy told me paul put on all those airs about his wife to keep her to himself paul was whats called a terrible possessor owning a wife with him meant owning her she wasnt anybody elses business either to praise her or so much as name her and hed thank people not to think of her murphys idea was that a man like paul wouldnt be spoken to about a wife in any way the world knew how to speak j   wild grapes what tree may not the fig be gathered from the grape may not be gathered from the birch its all you mow the grape or know the birch as a girl gathered from the birch myself equally with my weight in grapes one autumn i ought to mow what tree the grape is fruit of i was born i suppose like anyone and grew to be a little boyish girl my brother could not always leave at home but that beginning was wiped out in fear the day i swung suspended with the grapes and was come after like eurydice and brought down safely from the upper regions and the life i live nows an extra life i can waste as i please on whom i please so if you see me celebrate two birthdays and give myself out as two different ages one of them five years younger than i look one day my brother led me to a glade where a white birch he knew of stood alone wearing a thin headdress of pointed leaves and heavy on her heavy harr behind against her neck an ornament of grapes grapes i knew grapes from having seen them last yea r one bunch of them and there began to be bunches all round me growing in white birches the way they grew round leif the luckys german mostly as much beyond my lifted hands though as the moon used to seem when i was younger and only freely to be had for climbing    my brother did the climbing and at first threw me down grapes to miss and scatter and have to hunt fer in sweet fern and hardhack which gave him some time to himself to eat but not so much perhaps as a boy needed so then to make me wholly selfsupporting he climbed still higher and bent the tree to earth and put it in my hands to pick my own grapes here take a treetop ill get down another hold on with all your might when i let go i said i had the tree it wasnt true the opposite was true the tree had me the minute it was left with me alone it caught me up as if i were the fish and it the fishpole so i was translated to loud cries from my brother of let go dont you mow anything you girl let gor but i with something of the baby grip acquired ancestrally in just such trees when wilder mothers than our wildest now hung babies out on branches by the hands to dry or wash or tan i dont mow which youll have to ask an evolutionist i held on uncomplainingly for life my brother tried to make me laugh to help me what are you doing up there in those grapes dont be afraid a few of them wont hurt you i mean they wont pick you if you dont them much danger of my picking anything by that time i was pretty well reduced to a philosophy of hangandiethang now you mow how it feels my brother said to be a bunch of foxgrapes as they call them    that when it thinks it has escaped the fox by growing where it shouldnton a birch where a fox wouldnt think to look for it and if he looked and found it couldnt reach it just then come you and i to gather it only you have the advantage of the grapes in one way you have one more stem to cling by and promise more resistance to the picker one by one i lost off my hat and shoes and still i clung i let my head fall back and shut my eyes against the sun my ears against my brothers nonsense drop he said ill catch you in my arms it isnt far stated in lengths of him it might not be drop or ill shake the tree and shake you down grim silence on my part as i sank lower my small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo strings why if she isnt serious about itl hold tight awhile till i think what to do  bend the tree down and let you down by it i dont know much about the letting down but once i felt ground with my stocking feet and the world came revolving back to me i know i looked long at my curledup fingers before i straightened them and brushed the bark off my brother said dont you weigh anything try to weigh something next time so you wont be run off with by birch trees into space it wasnt my not weighing anything so much as my not knowing anything     my brother had been nearer right before i had not taken the first step in knowledge i had not learned to let go with the hands as still i have not learned to with the heart and have no wish to with the heartnor need that i can see the mindis not the heart i may yet live as i know others live to wish in vain to let go with the mind of cares at night to sleep but nothing tells me that i need learn to let go with the heart    place for a third nothing to say to all those marriages she had made three hersef to three of his the score was even for them three to three but come to die she found she cared so much she thought of children in a burial row three children in a burial row were sad one mans three women in a burial row somehow made her impatient with the man and so she said to laban you have done a good deal right dont do the last thing wrong dont make me lie with those two other women laban said no he would not make her lie with anyone but that she had a mind to if that was how she felt of course he said she went her way but laban having caught this glimpse of lingering person in eliza and anxious to make all he could of it with something he remembered in himsef tried to think how he could exceed his promise and give good measure to the dead though thankless if that was how she felt he kept repeating his first thought under pressure was a grave in a new boughten grave plot by hersef under he didnt care how great a stone hed sell a yoke of steers to pay for it and werent there special cemetery flowers that once grief sets to growing grief may rest the flowers will go on with grief awhile and no one seem neglecting or neglected a prudent grief will not despise such aids    he thought of evergreen and everlasting and then he had a thought worth many of these somewhere must be the grave of the young boy who married her for playmate more than helpmate and sometimes laughed at what it was between them how would she lke to seep her last with him where was his grave did laban know his name he found the grave a town or two away the headstone cut with john beloved husband beside it room reserved the say a sisters a nevermarried sisters of that husband whether eliza would be welcome there the dead was bound to silence ask the sister so laban saw the sister and saying nothing of where eliza wanted not to lie and who had thought to lay her with her first love begged simply for the grave the sisters face fell all in wrinkles of responsibility she wanted to do right shed have to think laban was old and poor yet seemed to care and she was old and poorbut she cared too they sat she cast one dull old look at him then turned him out to go on other errands she said he might attend to in the village while she made up her mind how much she cared and how much laban caredand why he cared she made shrewd eyes to see where he came in shed looked eliza up her second time a widow at her second husbands grave and offered her a home to rest awhile before she went the poor mans widows way housekeeping for the next man out of wedlock    she and eliza had been friends through all who was she to judge marriage in a world whose bibles so confused in marriage counsel the sister hld not come across this laban a decent product of lifes ironingout she must not keep him waiting time would press between the death day and the funeral day so when she saw him coming in the street she hurried her decision to be ready to meet him vith his answer at the door laban had known about what it would be from the way she had set her poor old mouth to do as she had put it what was right she gave it through the screen door closed between them no not with john there wouldnt be no sense elizas had too many other men laban was forced to fall back on his plan to buy eliza a plot to lie alone in which gives him for himself a choice of lots when his time comes to die and settle down    two witches i the witch of coos i stayed the night for shelter at a farm behind the mountain with a mother and son two oldbelievers they did all the talking m o t h e r  folks think a witch who has familiar spirits she could call up to pass a winter evening but wont should be burned at the stake or something summoning spirits isnt button button whos got the button i would have them know son mother can make a common table rear and kick with two legs like an army mule mother and when ive done it what good have i doner rather than tip a table for you let me tell you what raile the sioux control once told me he said the dead had souls but when i asked him how could that bei thought the dead were souls he broke my trance dont that make you suspicious that theres something the dead are keeping back yes thees something the dead are keeping back son you wouldnt want to tell him what we have up attic mother mother bonesa skeleton son but the headboard of mothers bed is pushed against the attic door the door is nailed    its harmless mother hears it in the night halting perplexed behind the barrier of door and headboard where it wants to get is back into the cellar where it came from mother well never let them will we sonl well neverl son it left the cellar forty years ago and carried itself like a pile of dishes up one bight from the cellar to the kitchen another from the kitchen to the bedroom another from the bedroom to the attic right past both father and mother and neither stopped it father had gone upstairs mother was downstairs i was a baby i dont know where i was mother the only fault liy husband found with me l went to sleep before i went to bed especially in winter when the bed might just as well be ice and the clothes snow the night the bones came up the cellarstairs toffile had gone to bed alone and left me but left an open door to cool the room off so as to sort of turn me out of it i was just coming to myself enough to wonder where the cold was coming from when i heard toffile upstairs in the bedroom and thought i heard him downstairs in the cellar the board we had laid down to walk dryshod on when there was water in the cellar in spring struck the hard cellar bottom and then someone began the stairs two footsteps for each step the way a man with one leg and a crutch    or a little child comes up it wasnt toffile it wasnt anyone who could be there the bulkhead doubledoors were doublelocked and swollen tight and buried under snow the cellar windows were banked up with sawdust and swollen tight and buried under snow it was the bones i knew themand good reason my first impulse was to get to the knob and hold the door but the bones didnt try the door they halted helpless on the landing waiting for things to happen in their favor the faintest restless rustling ran all through them i never could have done the thing i did if the wish hacnt been too strong in me to see how they were mounted for this walk r had a vision of them put together not like a man but like a chandelier so suddenly i hung the door wide on him a moment he stood balancing with emotion and all but lost himself a tongue of fire flashed out and licked along his upper teeth smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes then he came at me with one hand outstretched the way he did in life once but this time i struck the hand off brittle on the hoar and fell back from him on the hoar myself the fingerpieces slid in all directions where did i see one of those pieces lately hand me my buttonboxit must be there i sat up on the hoar and shouted toffile its coming up to you it had its choice of the door to the cellar or the hall it took the hall door for the novelty    and set off briskly for so slow a thing still going every which way in the joints though so that it looked like lightning or a scribble from the slap i had just now given its hand i listened till it almost climbed the stairs from the hall to the only finished bedroom before i got up to do anything then ran and shouted shut the bedroom door toffile for my sakei company he said dont make me get up im too warm in bed so lying forward weakly on the handrail i pushed myself upstairs and in the light the kitchen had been dark i had to own i could see nothing toffile i dont see it its with us in the room though its the bones what bones the cellar bonesout of the grave that made him throw his bare legs out of bed and sit up by me and take hold of me i wanted to put out the light and see if i could see it or else mow the room with our arms at the level of our lmees and bring the chalkpile down ill tell you what its looking for another door to try the uncommonly deep snow has made him think of his old song the wild colonial boy he always used to sing along the tote road hes after an open door to get outdoors lets trap him with an open door up attic toffile agreed to that and sure enough almost the moment he was given an opening the steps began to climb the attic stairs i heard them toffile didnt seem to hear them quickl i slammed to the door and held the knob    toffile get nails i made him nail the door shut and push the headboard of the bed against it then we asked was there anything up attic that wed ever want again the attic was less to us than the cellar if the bones liked the attic let them have it let them stay in the attic when they sometimes come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed behind the door and headboard of the bed brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers with sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter thats what i sit up in the dark to say to no one any more since toffile died let them stay in the attic since they went there i promised toffile to be cruel to them for helping them be cruel once to him son we think they had a grave down in the cellar mother we know they had a grave down in the cellar son we never could find out whose bones they were mother yes we could too son tell the truth for once they were a mans his father killed for me i mean a man he killed instead of me the least i could do was to help dig their grave we were about it one night in the cellar son knows the story but twas not for him to tell the truth suppose the time had come son looks surprised to see me end a lie wed kept all these years between ourselves so as to have it ready for outsiders j   but tonight i dont care enough to lie i dont remember why i ever cared toffile if he were here i dont believe could tell you why he ever cared himself she hadnt found the flngerbone she wanted among the buttons poured out in her lap i verified the name next morning toffile the rural letter box said toffile lajway ii the pauper witch of grafton now that theyve got it settled whose i be im going to tell them something they wont like theyve got it settled wrong and i can prove it flattered i must be to have two towns fighting to make a present of me to each other they dont dispose me either one of them to spare them any trouble double troubles always the witchs motto anyway  double theirs for both of themyou watch me theyll flnd theyve got the whole thing to do over that is if facts is what they want to go by they set a lot now dont they by a record of arthur amys having once been up for hog reeve in march meeting here in warren i could have told them any time this twelvemonth the arthur amy i was married to couldnt have been the one they say was up in warren at march meeting for the reason he want but fifteen at the time they say j   the arthur amy i was married to voted the only times he ever voted which wasnt many in the town of wentworth one of the times was when twas in the warrant to see if the town wanted to take over the tote road to our clearing where we lived ill tell you whod rememberheman lapish their arthur amy was the father of mine so now theyve dragged it through the law courts once i guess theyd better drag it through again wentworth and warrens both good towns to live in only i happen to prefer to live in wentworth from now on and when alls said rights right and the temptation to do right when i can hurt someone by doing it has always been too much for me it has i know of some folks thatd be set up at having in their town a noted witch but most would have to think of the expense that even i would be they ought to know that as a witch id often milk a bat and thatd be enough to last for days itd make my position stronger think if i was to consent to give some sign to make it surer that i was a witch it want no sign i spose when mallice huse said that i took him out in his old age and rode all over everything on him until id had him worn to skin and bones and if id left him hitched unblanketed in front of one town hall id left him hitched in front of every one in grafton county some cried shame on me not to blanket him    the poor old man it would have been all right if someone hadnt said to gnaw the posts he stood beside and leave his trade mark on them so they could recognize them not a post that they could hear tell of was scarified they made him keep oil gnawing till he whined then that same smarty someone said to look hed bet huse was a cribber and had gnawed the crib he slept inand as sures youre born they found hed gnawed the four posts of his bed all four of them to splinters what did that prove not that he hadnt gnawed the hitching posts he said he had besides because a horse gnaws in the stable aint no proof to me he dont gnaw trees and posts and fences too but everybody took it for a proof i was a strapping girl of twenty then the smarty someone who spoiled everything was arthur amy you bow who he was that was the way he started courting me he never said much after we were married but i mistrusted he was none too proud of having interfered in the huse business i guess he found he got more out of me by having me a witch or something happened to turn him round he got to saying things to undo what hed done and make it right like no she aint come back from kiting yet last night was one of her nights out shes kiting she thinks when the wind makes a night of it she might as well herself but he liked best to let on he was plagued to death with me if anyone had seen me coming home    over the ridgepole stride of a broomstick as often as he had in the tail of the night he guessed theyd know what he had to put up with well i showed arthur amy signs enough off from the house as far as we could keep and from barn smells you cant wash out of plowed ground with all the rain and snow of seven years and i dont mean just skulls of rogers rangers on moosilauke but woman signs to man only bewitched so i would last him longer up where the trees grow short the mosses tall i made him gather me wet snow berries on slippery rocks besde a waterfall i made him do it for me in the dark and he liked everything i made him do i hope if he is where he sees me now hes so far off he cant see what ive come to you can come down from everything to nothing all is if id aknown when i was young and full of it that this would be the end it doesnt seem as if id had the courage to make so free and kick up in folks faces i might have but it doesnt seem as if j   an empty threat i stay but it isnt as if there wasnt always hudsons bay and the fur trade a small skiff and a paddle blade i can just see my tent pegged and me on the floor crosslegged and a trapper looking in at the door with furs to sell his names joe alias john and between what he doesnt know and wont tell about where henry hudsons gone i cant say hes much help but we get on the seal yelp on an ice cake its not men by some mistake no theres not a soul for a windbreak between me and the north pole except always johnjoe my french indian esquimaux    and hes off setting traps in one himself perhaps give a head shake over so much bay thrown away in snow and mist that doesnt exist i was going to say for god man or beasts sake yet does perhaps for all three dont ask joe what it is to him its sometimes dim what it is to me unless it be its the old captains dark fate who failed to find or force a strait in its twothousandmile coast and his crew left him where he failed and nothing came of all he sailed its to say you and l to such a ghost you and i off here with the dead race of the great auld and better defeat almost if seen clear than lifes victories of doubt that need endless talk talk to make them out    a fountain a bottle a donkeys ears and some books old davis owned a solid mica mountain in dalton that would some day make his fortune thered been some boston people out to see it and experts said that deep down in the mountain the mica sheets were big as plate glass windows hed like to take me there and show it to me ill tell you what you show me you remember you said you knew the place where once on kinsman the early mormons made a settlement and built a stone baptismal font outdoors but smith or someone called them off the mountain to go west to a worse fight with the desert you said youd seen the stone baptismal font well take me there some day i will today huh that old bathtub what is that to see lets talk about it lets go see the place to shut you up ill tell you what ill do ill find that fountain if it takes all summer and both of our united strengths to do it youve lost it then    not so but i can find it no doubt its grown up some to woods around it the mountain may have shifted since i saw it in eightyfive as long ago as that if i remember rightly it had sprung a leak and emptied then and forty years can do a good deal to bad masonry you wont see any mormon swimming in it but you have said it and were off to find it old as i am im going to let myself be dragged by you all over everywhere i thought you were a guide i am a guide and thats why i cant decently refuse you we made a day of it out of the world ascending to descend to reascend the old man seriously took his bearings and spoke his doubts in every open place we came out on a lookoff where we faced a cliff and on the cliff a bottle painted or stained by vegetation from above a likeness to surprise the thrilly tourist well if i havent brought you to the fountain at least ive brought you to the famous bottle i wont accept the substitute its empty    sos everything i want my fountain i guess youd bnd the fountain just as empty and anyway this tells me where i am hadnt you long suspected where you were you mean miles from that mormon settlement look here you treat your guide with due respect if you dont want to spend the night outdoors i vow we must be near the place from where the two converging slides the avalanches on marshall look like donkeys ears we may as well see that and save the day dont donkeys ears suggest we shake our own for gods sake arent you fond of viewing nature you dont like nature all you like is books what signify a donkeys ears and bottle however natural give you your booksi well then right here is where i show you books come straight down off this mountain just as fast as we can fall and keep abouncing on our feet its hell for knees unless done hellforleather be ready i thought for almost anything we struck a road i didnt recognize but welcomed for the chance to lave my shoes in dust once more we followed this a mile    perhaps to where it ended at a house i didnt know was there it was the kind to bring me to for broadboard paneling i never saw so good a house deserted excuse me if i ask you in a window that happens to be broken davis said the outside doors as yet have held against us i want to introduce you to the people who used to live here they were robinsons you must have heard of clara robinson the poetess who wrote the book of verses and had it published it was all about the posies on her inner window sill and the birds on her outer window sill and how she tended both or had them tended she never tended anything herself she was shut in for life she lived her whole life long in bed and wrote her things in bed ill show you how she had her sills extended to entertain the birds and hold the flowers our business firsts up attic with her books we trod uncomfortably on crunching glass through a house stripped of everything except it seemed the poetesss poems books i should saylif books are what is needed a whole edition in a packingcase that overflowing like a horn of plenty or like the poetesss heart of love had spilled them near the window toward the light where driven rain had wet and swollen them enough to stock a village library j   unfortunately all of one kind though they had been brought home from some publisher and taken thus into the family boys and bad hunters had known what to do with stone and lead to unprotected glass shatter it inward on the unswept floors how had the tender verse escaped their outrage by being invisible for what it was or else by some remoteness that defied them to find out what to do to hurt a poem yet ohl the tempting flatness of a book to send it sailing out the attic window till it caught wind and opening out its covers tried to improve on sailing like a tile by flying like a bird silent in flight but all the burden of its body song only to tumble like a stricken bird and lie in stones and bushes unretrieved books were not thrown breverently about they simply lay where someone now and then having tried one had dropped it at his feet and left it lying where it fell rejected here were all those the poetesss life had been too short to sell or give away take one old davis bade me graciously wby not take two or three take all you want goodlooking books like that he picked one fresh in virgin wrapper from deep in the box and stroked it with a hornyhanded kindness    he read in one and i read iii another both either looking for or finding something the attic wasps went missing by like bullets i was soon satisfied for the time being all the way home i kept remembering the small book in my pocket it was there the poetess had sighed i knew in heaven at having eased her heart of one more copy legitimately my demand upon her though slight was a demand she felt the tug in time she would be rid of all her books    i will sing you oneo it was long i lay awake that night wishing the tower would name the hour and tell me whether to call it day though not yet light and give up sleep the snow fell deep with the hiss of spray two winds would meet one down one street one down another and fight in a smother of dust and feather i could not say but feared the cold had checked the pace of the tower clock by tying together its hands of gold before its face then came one knockl a note unruffled of earthly weather though strange and muffled the tower said one and then a steeple they spoke to themselves and such few people    as winds might rouse from sleeping warm but not unhouse they left the storm that struck en masse my window glass like a beaded fur in that grave one they spoke of the sun and moon and stars saturn and mars and jupiter still more unfettered they left the named and spoke of the lettered the sigmas and taus of constellations they filled their throats with the furthest bodies to which man sends his speculation beyond which god is the cosmic motes of yawning lenses their solemn peals were not their own they spoke for the clock with whose vast wheels theirs interlock in that grave word uttered alone the utmost star trembled and stirred j   though set so far its whirling frenzies appear like standing in one self station it has not ranged and save for the wonder of once expanding to be a nova it has not changed to the eye of man on planets over around and under it in creation since man began to drag down man and nation nation    fragmentary blue why make so much of fragmentary blue in here and there a bird or butterfly or flower or wearingstone or open eye when heaven presents in sheets the solid hue since earth is earth perhaps not heaven as yet though some savants make earth include the sky and blue so far above us comes so high it only gives our wish for blue a whet    fire and ice some say the world will end in fire some say in ice from what ive tasted of desire i hold with those who favor fire but if it had to perish twice i think i know enough of hate to say that for destruction ice is also great and would suffice    in a disused graveyard the living come with grassy tread to read the gravestones on the hill the graveyard draws the living still but never any more the dead the verses in it say and say the ones who living come today to read the stones and go away tomorrow dead will come to stay so sure of death the marbles rhyme yet cant help marking all the time how no one dead will seem to come what is it men are shrinking from it would be easy to be clever and tell the stones men hate to die and have stopped dying now forever i think they would believe the lie    dust of snow the way a crow shook down on me the dust of snow from a hemlock tree has given my heart a change of mood and saved some part of a day i had rued    to e t i slumbered with your poems on my breast spread open as i dropped them halfread through like dove wings on a figure on a tomb to see if in a dream they brought of you i might not have the chance i missed in life through some delay and call you to your face first soldier and then poet and then both who died a soldierpoet of your race i meant you meant that nothing should remain unsaid between us brother and this remained and one thing more that was not then to say the victory for what it lost and gained you went to meet the shells embrace of fire on vimy ridge and when you fell that day the war seemed over more for you than me but now for me than youthe other way how over though for even me who knew the foe thrust back unsafe beyond the rhine h i was not to speak of it to you and see you pleased once more with words of mine    nothing gold can stay natures first green is gold her hardest hue to hold her early leafs a hower but only so an hour then leaf subsides to leaf so eden sank to grief so dawn goes down to day nothing gold can stay j   the runaway once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall we stopped by a mountain pasture to say whose colt a little morgan had one forefoot on the wall the other curled at his breast he dipped his head and snorted at us and then he had to bolt we heard the miniature thunder where he fled and we saw him or thought we saw him dim and gray like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes i think the little fellows afraid of the snow he isnt winterbroken it isnt play with the little fellow at all hes running away i doubt if even his mother could tell him sakes its only weather hed think she didnt know where is his mother he cant be out alone and now he comes again with clatter of stone and mounts the wall again with whited eyes and all his tail that isnt hair up straight he shudders his coat as if to throw off flies whoever it is that leaves him out so late when other creatures have gone to stall and bin ought to be told to come and take him in    the aim was song before man came to blow it right the wind once blew itself untaught and did its loudest day and night in any rough place where it caught man came to tell it what was wrong it hadnt found the place to blow it blew too hardthe aim was song and listenhow it ought to gol he took a little in his mouth and held it long enough for north to be converted into south and then by measure blew it forth by measure it was word and note the wind the wind had meant to be a little through the lips and throat the aim was songthe wind could see      stopping by woods on a snowy evening whose woods these are i think i know his house is in the village though he will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow my little horse must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near between the woods and frozen lake the darkest evening of the year he gives his harness bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake the only other sounds the sweep of easy wind and downy flake the woods are lovely dark and deep but i have promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep and miles to go before i sleep j   for once then something others taunt me with having knelt at wellcurbs always wrong to the light so never seeing deeper down in the well than where the water gives me back in a shining surface picture me myself in the summer heaven godlike looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs once when trying with chin against a wellcurb i discerned as i thought beyond the picture through the picture a something white uncertain something more of the depthsand then i lost it water came to rebuke the too clear water one drop fell from a fern and  a ripple shook whatever it was lay there at bottom blurred it blotted it out what was that whiteness truth a pebble of quartz for once then something    bluebutterfly day it is bluebutterfly day here in spring and with these skyflakes down in flurry on flurry there is more unmixed color on the wing than flowers will show for days unless they hurry but these are flowers that fly and all but sing and now from having ridden out desire they lie closed over in the wind and cling where wheels have freshly sliced the april mire    the onset always the same when on a fated night at last the gathered snow lets down as white as may be in dark woods and with a song it shall not make again all winter long of hissing on the yet uncovered ground i almost stumble looking up and round as one who overtaken by the end gives up his errand and lets death descend upon him where he is with nothing done to evil no important triumph won more than if life had never been begun yet all the precedent is on my side i know that winter death has never tried the earth but it has failed the snow may heap in long storms an undrifted four feet deep as measured against maple birch and oak it cannot check the peepers silver croak and i shall see the snow all go down hill in water of a slender april rill that flashes tail through last years withered brake and dead weeds like a disappearing snake nothing will be left white but here a birch and there a clump of houses with a church    to earthward love at the lips was touch as sweet as i could bear and once that seemed too much i lived on air that crossed me from sweet things the flow ofwas it musk from hidden grapevine springs down hill at dusk i had the swirl and ache from sprays of honeysuckle that when theyre gathered shake dew on the knuckle i craved strong sweets but those seemed strong when i was young the petal of the rose it was that stung now no joy but lacks salt that is not dashed with pain and weariness and fault i crave the stain of tears the aftermark of almost too much love the sweet of bitter bark and burning clove when stiff and sore and scarred i take away my hand    from leaning on it hard in grass and sand the hurt is not enough i long for weight and strength to feel the earth as rough to all my length    goodby and keep cold this saying goodby on the edge of the dark and the cold to an orchard so young in the bark reminds me of all that can happen to harm an orchard away at the end of the farm all winter cut off by a hill from the house i dont want it girdled by rabbit and mouse i dont want it dreamily nibbled for browse by deer and i dont want it budded by grouse if certain it wouldnt be idle to call id summon grouse rabbit and deer to the wall and warn them away with a stick for a gun i dont want it stirred by the heat of the sun we made it secure against being i hope by setting it out on a northerly slope no orchards the worse for the wintriest storm but one thing about it it mustnt get warm how often already youve had to be told keep cold young orchard goodby and keep cold dread fifty above more than fifty below i have to be gone for a season or so my business awhile is with different trees less carefully nurtured less fruitful than these and such as is done to their wood with an ax maples and birches and tamaracks i wish i could promise to lie in the night and think of an orchards arboreal plight when slowly and nobody comes with a light its heart sinks lower under the sod but something has to be left to god    two look at two love and forgetting might have carried them a little further up the mountamside with night so near but not much further up they must have halted soon in any case with thoughts of the path back how rough it was with rock and washout and unsafe in darkness when they were halted by a tumbled wall with barbedwire binding they stood facing this spending what onward impulse they still had in one last look the way they must not go on up the failing path where if a stone or earthslide moved at night it moved itself no footstep moved it this is all they sighed goodnight to woods but not so there was more a doe from round a spruce stood looking at them across the wall as near the wall as they she saw them in their field they her in hers the difficulty of seeing what stood still like some upended boulder split in two was in her clouded eyes they saw no fear there she seemed to think that two thus they were safe then as if they were something that though strange she could not trouble her mind with too long she sighed and passed unscared along the wall this then is all what more is there to ask but no not yet a snort to bid them wait a buck from round the spruce stood lookmg at them across the wall as near the wall as they this was an antlered buck of lusty nostril not the same doe come back into her place he viewed them quizzically with jerks of head    as if to ask why dont you make some motion or give some sign of life because you cant i doubt if youre as living as you look thus till he had them almost feeling dared to stretch a proffering handand a spellbreaking then he too passed unscared along the wall two had seen two whichever side you spoke from this must be all it was all still they stood a great wave from it going over them as if the earth in one unlookedfor favor had made them certain earth returned their love j   not to keep they sent him back to her the letter came saying  and she could have him and before she could be sure there was no hidden iii under the formal writing he was there living they gave him back to her ahve how else they are not known to send the dead and not disfigured visibly his face his hands she had to look to look and ask what is it dear and she had given all and still she had allthey hadthey the lucky wasnt she glad now everytlnng seemed won and all the rest for them permissible ease she had to ask what was it dear enough yet not enough a bullet through and through high in the breast nothing but what good care and medicine and rest and you a week can cure me of to go again the same grim giving to do over for them both she dared no more than ask him with her eyes how was it with him for a second trial and with his eyes he asked her not to ask they had given him back to her but not to keep j   a brook in tile city the farmhouse lmgers though averse to square with the new city street it has to wear a number in but what about the brook that held the house as m an elbowcrook i ask as one who knew the brook its strength and impulse having dipped a finger length and made it leap my knuckle having tossed a hower to try its currents where they crossed the meadow grass could be cemented down from growmg under pavements of a town the apple trees be sent to hearthstone flame is water wood to serve a brook the same how else dispose of an immortal force no longer needed staunch it at its source with cmder loads dumped down the brook was thrown deep in a sewer dungeon under stone in fetid darkness still to live and ron and all for nothing it had ever done except forget to go in fear perhaps no one would know except for ancient maps that such a brook ran water but i wonder if from its being kept forever under the thoughts may not have risen that so keep this newbuilt city from both work and sleep    the kitchen chimney builder m building the httle house in every way you may please yourself but please please me in the kitchen chimney dont build me a chimney upon a shelf however far you must go for bricks whatever they cost apiece or a pound buy me enough for a fulllength chimney and build the chimney clear from the ground ifs not that rm greatly afraid of fire but i never heard of a house that throve and i know of one that didnt thrive where the chimney started above the stove and i dread the ominous stain of tar that there always is on the papered walls and the smell of fire drowned in rain that there always is when the chimneys false a shelfs for a clock or vase or picture but i dont see why it should have to bear a chimney that only would serve to remind me of castles i used to build in air    looking for a sunset bird in winter the west was getting out of gold the breath of air had died of cold when shoeing home across the white i thought i saw a bird alight in summer when i passed the place i had to stop and lift my face a bird with an angelic gift was singing in it sweet and swift no bird was singmg in it now a single leaf was on a bough and that was all there was to see in going twice around the tree from my advantage on a hill i judged that such a crystal chill was only adding frost to snow as gilt to gold that wouldnt show a brush had left a crooked stroke of what was either cloud or smoke from north to south across the blue a piercing little star was through    a boundless moment he halted in the wind andwhat was that far in the maples pale but not a ghost he stood there bringing march agamst his thought and yet too ready to beheve the most ob thats the paradiseinbloom i said and truly it was fair enough for flowers had we but in us to assume in march such white luxuriance of may for ours we stood a moment so in a strange world myself as one his own pretense deceives and then i said the truth and we moved on a young beech chnging to its last years leaves    evening in a sugar orchard from where i lingeled in a lull in arch outside the sugarhouse one night for choice i called the fireman with a careful voice and bade rum leave the pan and stoke the arch o fireman give the fire another stoke and send more sparks up chimney with the smoke i thought a few might tangle as they did among bare maple boughs and in the rare hill atmosphere not cease to glow and so be added to the moon up there the moon though slight was moon enough to show on every tree a bucket with a lid and on black ground a bearskin rug of snow the sparks made no attempt to be the moon they were content to figure in the trees as leo orion and the pleiades and that was what the boughs were full of soon    gathering leaves spades take up leaves no better than spoons and bags full of leaves are hght as balloons i make a great noise of rusthng all day like rabbit and deer running away but the mountains i raise elude my embrace flowing over my arms and into my face i may load and unload again and again till i fill the whole shed and what have i then next to nothing for weight and since they grew duller from contact with earth next to nothing for color next to nothing for use but a crop is a crop and whds to say where the harvest shall stop    the valleys singing day the sound of the closmg outside door was all you made no sound in the grass with your footfall as far as you went from the door which was not far but you had awakened under the morning star the first songbird that awakened all the est he could have slept but a moment more at best already determined dawn began to lay in place across a cloud the slender ray for prying beneath and forcing the lids of sight and loosing the pentup music of overnight but dawn was not to begm their pearlypearly by which they mean the rrun is pearls so early before it changes to diamonds in the sun neither was song that day to be selfbegun you had begun it and if there needed proof i was asleep still under the dripping roof my window curtain hung over the sill to wet but i should awake to confirm your story yet i should be willing to say and help you say that once you had opened the valleys singing day j   misgiving all crlng we will go with you  wmdf the foliage follow him leaf and stem but asleep oppresses them as they go and they end ly bidding him stay with them since ever they hung abroad ill spring the leaves had promised themselves this hight who now would fain seek sheltering wall or thicket or hollow place for the night and now they answer his summoning blast with an ever vaguer and vaguer stir or at utmost a little reluctant whirl that drops them no further than where they were i only hope that when i am free as they are free to go in quest of the knowledge beyond the bounds of life it may not seem better to me to rest    a hillside thaw to think to knov the country and not know the hillside on the day the sun lets go ten million silver hzards out of snowi as often as ive seen it done before i cant pretend to tell the vay ifs done it looks as if some magic of the sun lifted the rug that bred them on the floor and the light breaking on them made them run but if i thought to stop the wet stampede and caught one silver lizard by the tall and put my foot on one without avail and threw myself wetelbowed and wetkneed in front of twenty others wngglmg speed in the confusion of them all aglitter and birds that joined in the excited fun by doubling and redoubling song and twitter i have no doubt id end by holding none it takes the moon for this the suns a wizard by all i tell but sos the moon a witch from the ugh west she makes a gentle cast and suddenly without a jerk or twitch she has her spell on every single lizard i fancied when i looked at six oclock the swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast the moon was waiting for her chill effect i looked at nine the swarm was turned to rock in every lifelike posture of the svarm transfixed on mountain slopes almost erect across each other and side by side they lay the spell that so could hold them as they were    was wrought through trees without a breath of storm to make a leaf if there had been one stir it was the moons she held them until day one lizard at the end of every ray the thought of my attempting such a stay j   plovjen a plow they say to plov the snow they cannot mean to plant it no unless in bitterness to mock at having cultivated rock   on a tree fallen across the road to hear us talk the tree the tempest with a crash of wood throws down in front of us is not to bar our passage to our journeys end for good but just to ask us who we think we are insisting always on our own way so she likes to halt us in our runner tracks and make us get down in a foot of snow debating what to do without an ax and yet she knows obstruction is in vain we will not be put off the final goal we have it hidden in us to attain not though we have to seize earth by the pole and tired of aimless circling in one place steer straight off after something into space    our singing strength it snowed in sprmg on earth so dly and warm the hakes could find no landing place to form hordes spent themselves to make it wet and cold and still they failed of any lasting hold they made no white impression on the black they disappeared as if earth sent them back not till from separate flakes they changed at night to almost strips and tapes of ragged white did grass and garden ground confess it snowed and all go back to winter but the road next day the scene was piled and puffed and dead the grass lay flattened under one great tread borne down until the end almost took root the rangey bough anticipated fruit with snowballs cupped in every opening bud the road alone maintained itself in mud whatever its secret was of greater heat from inward fires or brush of passing feet in spring more mortal singers than belong to anyone place cover us with song thrush bluebird blackbird sparrow and robin throng some to go further north to hudsons bay some that have come too far north back away really a very few to build and stay now was seen how these liked belated snow the fields had nowhere left for them to go theyd soon exhausted all there was in hying the trees theyd had enough of with once trymg and setting off their heavy powder load they could find nothing open but the road    so there they let their bves be narrowed in by thousands the bad weather made akin the road became a channel running flocks of glossy birds like ripples over rocks i drove them under foot in bits of flight that kept the ground almost disputing right of way with me from apathy of wing a talking twitter all they had to sing a few i must have dnven to despair lvlade quick asides but havmg done in air a whrr among white branches great and small as in some too much carven marble hall where one false wing beat would have brought down all came tamely back in front of me the drover to suffer the same driven nightmare over one such storm in a lifetime couldnt teach them that back behmd pursuit it couldnt reach them none flew behind me to be left alone well something for a snowstorm to have shown the countrys singing strength thus brought together that though repressed and moody with the weather was none the less there ready to be freed and sing the wildhowers up from root and seed    the lockless door it went many years but at last came a knock and i thought of the door with no lock to lock i blew out the light i tiptoed the hoor and raised both hands in prayer to the door but the knock came again my window was wide i climbed on the sill and descended outside back over the sill i bade a ccome in to whatever the knock at the door may have been so at a knock i emptied my cage to hide in the world and alter with age    the need of being versed in country things the house had gone to bring again to the midnight sky a sunset glow now the chimney was all of the house that stood like a pistil after the petals go the bam opposed across the way that would have joined the house in flame had it been the will of the wind was left to bear forsaken the places name no more it opened with all one end for teams that came by the stony road to drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs and brush the mow with the summer load the birds that came to it through the air at broken wmdows hew out and in their murmur more like the sigh we sigh from too much dwelling on what has been yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf and the aged elm though touched with fire and the dry pump flung up an awkward arm and the fence post carried a strand of wire for them there was really nothing sad but though they rejoiced in the nest they kept one had to be versed in country things not to believe the phoebes wept    westrunning brook   spring pools these pools that though in forest till reflect the total sky almost without defect and hke the

being shore to the ocean holding the curve of one position counting an endless repetition     on going unnoticed as vain to raise a voice as a sigh in the tumult of free leaves on high what are you in the shadov of bees engaged up there with the light and breeze less than the coralroot you know that is content with the dayhght low and has no leaves at all of its own whose spotted flowers hang meanly down you grasp the bark by a rugged pleat and look up small from the forests feet the only leaf it drops goes wide your name not wntten on either side you hnger your little hour and are gone and still the woods sweep leafily on not even missing the coralroot flower   the cocoon as far as i can see tlus autumn haze that spreading iii the evening air both ways makes the new moon look anything but new and pours the elmtree meadow full of blue is all the smoke from one poor house alone with but one chimney it can call its own so close it will not light an early light keepmg its life so close and out of sight no one for hours has set a foot outdoors so much as to take care of evenmg chores the inmates may be lonely womenfolk i want to tell them that with all this smoke they

my mind that no one on earth will ever find heaven gives its glimpses only to those not in position to look too close   a peck of gold dust always blowing about the town except when seafog laid it down and i was one of the children told some of the blowing dust was gold all the dust the wind blew high appeared hke gold in the sunset sky but i was one of the children told some of the dust was really gold such was hfe in the golden gate gold dusted all we drank and ate and i vilas one of the children told we all must eat our peck of gold    accept ance when the spent sun thiows up its rays on cloud and goes down burning into the gulf belov no voice in nature is heard to cry aloud at what has happened birds at least must know it is the change to darkness in the sky murmunng something quiet in her breast one bird begins to close a faded eye i or overtaken too far from his nest  hurrying low above the grove some waif swoops just in time to his remembered tree at most he thinks or twitters softly safe i now let the night be dark for all of me let the night be too dark for me to see into the future let what will be be   once by the pacific the shattered water made a misty din great waves looked over others coming in and thought of doing something to the shore that water never did to land before the clouds were low and hairy in the skies like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes you could not tell and yet it looked as if the shore was lucky in being backed by chff the cliff in being backed by contment it looked as if a night of dark intent was coming and not only a night an age someone had better be prepared for rage there would be more than oceanwater broken before gods last put out the light was spoken    lodged the rain to the wind said cyou push and ill pelt  they so smote the garden bed that the flowers actually knelt and lay lodgedthough not dead i know how the flowers felt   a minor bird i have wished a bird would flyaway and not sing by my house all day have clapped my hands at him from the door when it seemed as if i could bear no more the fault must partly have been in me the bird was not to blame for his key and of course there must be something wrong in wanting to silence any song    bereft where had i heard this wind before change like tius to a deeper roal what woud it take my standing there for holding open a restive door loolnng down hill to a frothy shore summer was past and day was past somber clouds in the west were massed out ill the porchs sagging floor leaves got up in a coil and hissed blindly struck at my knee and missed something sinister in the tone told me my secret must be known word i was in the house alone somehow must have gotten abroad word i was in my hfe alone word i had no one left but god   tree at my window tree at my window vindow bee my sash is lowered when night comes on but let there never be curtain drawn between you and me vague dreamhead lifted out of the ground and thing next most diffuse to cloud not all your light tongues tallang aloud could be profound but tree i have seen you taken and tossed and if you have seen me when i slept you have seen me when i was taken and swept and all but lost that day she put our heads together fate had her imagmatlon about her your head so much concerned with outer mine with inner weather    the peaceful shepherd if heaven were to do again and on the pasture bars i leaned to hne the figures in between the dotted stars i should be tempted to forget i fear the crown of rule the scales of trade the cross of faith as hardly worth renewal for these have governed til our hves and see how men have warred the cross the crown the scales may all as well have been the sword   the thatch out alone in the wintel rain intent on giving and talang pain but never was i far out of sight of a certain upperwindow light the hght was what it was all about i would not go in till the hght went out it would not go out till i came ill well we should see which one would win we should see which one would be first to yield the world was a black mvislble field the rain by rights was snow for cold the wind was another layer of mold but the strangest thing in the thick old thatch where summer birds had been given hatch had fed in chorus and lived to hedge some still were living in hermitage and as i passed along the eaves so low i brushed the straw with my sleeves i hushed birds out of hole after hole into the darkness it grieved my soul it started a grief within a grief to think their case was beyond relief they could not go flymg about ill search of their nest again nor find a perch they must brood where they fell in mulch and mire trusting feathers and inward fire till daylight made it safe for a flyer my greater grief was by so much reduced as i thought of them without nest or roost that was how that grief started to melt they tell me the cottage where we dwelt    its windtorn thatch goes now unmended its life of hundreds of years has ended by letting the rain i knew outdoors in on to the upper chamber floors   a winter eden a winter garden in an alder swamp where conies now come out to sun and romp as near a paradise as it can be and not melt snow or start a dormant tree it lifts existence on a plane of snow one levellugher than the earth below one level nearer heaven overhead and last years berries shinmg scarlet red it lifts a gaunt luxuriating beast where he can stletch and hold his highest feast on some wild apple trees young tender bark what well may prove the years high girdle mark so near to paradise all pairing ends here loveless birds now flock as winter friends content with budinspecting they presume to say which buds are leaf and which are bloom a featherhammer gives a double knock this eden day is done at two oclock an hour of winter day might seem too short to make it worth lifes while to wake and sport    the flood blood has been harder to dam back than water just when we think we have it impounded safe behind new barrier walls and let it chafe it breaks away in some new kind of slaughter we choose to say it is let loose by the devil but power of blood itself releases blood it goes by might of being such a hood held high at so unnatural a level it will have outlet brave and not so brave weapons of war and implements of peace are but the pomts at which it finds release and now it is once more the tidal wave that when it has swept by leaves summits stained oh blood will out it cannot be contained   acquainted with the night i have been one acquainted with the night i have walked out in rainand back in rain i have outwalked the furthest city light i have looked down the saddest city lane i have passed by the watchman on his beat and dropped my eyes unwilling to explain i have stood stili and stopped the sound of feet when far away an interrupted cry came over houses from another street but not to call me back or say goodby and further still at an unearthly height one luminary clock against the sky proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right i have been one acquainted with the night    the lovely shall be choosers the voice said hurl her down the voices hov far down seven levels of the world how much time have we take twenty years she would refuse love safe with wealth and honorl the lovely shall be choosers shall they then let them choosei then we shall let her choose yes let her choose take up the task beyond her choosing invisible hands crowded on her shoulder in reachness to weigh upon her but she stood straight still in broad round earrings gold and jet with pearls and broad round suchlike brooch her cheeks high colored proud and the pride of friends the voice asked you can let her choose yes we can let her and still triumph do it by joys and leave her always blameless be her first joy her weddmg    that though a wedding is yetwell something they know he and she and after that her next joy that though she gneves her gnef is secret those friends know nothing of her grief to make it shameful her third joy that though now they cannot help but know they move in pleasure too far off to think much or much care give her a child at either knee for fourth joy to tell once and once only for them never to forget how once she walked in bnghtness and make them see it in the winter firelight but give her friends for then she dare not tell for their foregone incredulousness and be her next joy this her never having deigned to tell them make her among the humblest even seem to them less than they are hopeless of being known for what she has been failing of bemg loved for what she is give her the comfort for her sixth of knowing she fails from strangeness to a way of hfe she came to from too high too late to learn then send some one with eyes to see and wonder at her where she is and words to wonder in her heanng how she came there but without time to hnger for her story be her last joy her hearts going out to this one so that she almost speaks you know themseven in all trust us the voices said    westrunning brook fred where is north north north is there my love the brook runs west westrunning blook

married to each other well both be marned to the brook well build our bridge across it and the bridge shall be our arm thrown over it asleep beside it look look its wavmg to us with a wave to let us know it hears me why my dear that waves been standing off this jut of shore the black stream catching on a sunken rock flung backward on itself in one white wave and the white water rode the black forever    nat gaining but not losing like a bud white feathei flam the struggle of whose bleast flecked the dark stream and flecked the darker pool below the point and were at last dnven wnnkled in a white scarf against the far shore alders that waves been standing off this jut of shore ever since riveis i was going to say were made m heaven it wasnt waved to us it wasnt yet it was if not to you it was to mein an annunciation oh if you take it off to ladyland ast were the country of the amazons we men must see you to the confines of and leave you there ourselves forbid to enter it is your brookf i have no more to say yes you have too go on you thought of something speakmg of contraries see how the brook in that white wave runs counter to itself it is from that in water we were from long long before we were from any creature here we in our impatience of the steps get back to the beginning of beginnings the stream of everythmg that runs away some say existence like a pirouot and pirouette forever in one place stands still and dances but it runs away it seriously sadly runs away to fill the abyss void with emptiness it flows beside us in this water broo j   but it flows over us it flows between us to separate us far a panic moment it haws between us over us and with us and it is time strength tone light bfe and lave and even substance lapsing unsubstantial the universal cataract of death that spends to nothingnessand unresisted save by some strange resistance in itself not just a swerving but a throwmg back as if regret were in it and were sacred it has this throwing backward on itself so that the fall of most of it is always raising a little sending up a little our life runs down in sending up the clock the brook runs down in sending up our lne the sun runs down in sending up the brook and there is something sending up the sun it is thls backward motion toward the source against the stream that most we see ourselves in the tribute of the current to the source it is from this in nature we are from it is most us today will be the day you said so no today will be the day you said the brook was called westrunning brook today will be the day of what we both said    sand dunes sea waves are green and wet but up from where they die rise others vaster yet and those are brown and dry they are the sea made land to come at the fisher town and bury in solid sand the men she could not drown she may know cove and cape but she does not know manland if by any change of shape she hopes to cut off mind men left her a ship to sink they can leave her a hut as

hurled that lies unhfted now come dew come rust but still lies pointed as it plowed the dust if we who sight along it round the world see nothing worthy to have been its mark it is because like men we

nearly equal hope and in conjunction giving qulte a spread or if he rests from scientific tread tis only to sit back and sway his head through ninety odd degrees of arc it seems between two

spool to lesser spool it seldom overtaxed their strength they safely grew in slender length and if one broke by any chance the spinner saw it at a glance the spinner still was there to spin thats

behmd and let the other go on a way i knew pretty well what he had in mind he wanted to take my job for pay good blocks of oak it was i spht as large around as the chopping block and every piece i squarely hit fell splinterless as a cloven rock the blows that a life or selfcontrol spares to strike for the common good that day giving a loose to my soul i spent on the unimportant wood the sun was warm but the wind was chill you know how it is with an april day when the sun is out and the wind is still youre one month on in the middle of may but if you so much as dare to speak a cloud comes

appropriate tool except as a fellow handled an ax they had no way of knowing a fool nothing on either side was said they knew they had but to stay their stay and all their logic would fill my head    as that i had no right to play with what was another mans work for gain my nght might be love but theirs was need and where the two exist in twam theirs was the better nghtlgleed but yield vho will to

stooped and struck a little huckleberry the way a player curls around a football wrong shape wrong color and wrong scent i said the huckleberry rolled him on his head at last it was a fly he shot and missed and the fly circled round mmin derision but for the fly he might have made me think he had been at lus poetry companng nailhead with fly and fly with huckleberry how like a fly how very like a

at the age of five and after havmg entertained the bee and cast its flowers and all the stems but three it set itself to keep those three alive and downy wax the three began to thrive they had just given themselves a little twist and turned from looking up and being kissed to looking down and yet not being sad when came square hale with lets see what we had and two was all he counted one he missed but two for a beginnmg wasnt bad his little matthew also five years old was led mto the presence of the tree and raised among the leaves and duly told we mustnt touch them yet but see and seel and what was green would by and by be gold their name was called the gold hespendee as regularly as he went to feed the pig or milk the cow he visited the fruit the dew of night and morning on his boot dearer to him than any barnyard brute each swung in danger on its slender twig a bubble on a pipestem growing big long since they swung as three instead of two one more he thought to take him safely through three made it certain nothing fate could do with codlin moth or rusty parasite would keep him now from proving with a bite that the name gold hesperidee was right    and so he brought them to the verge of frost but one day when the foliage all went swish with autunln and the fruit was rudely tossed he thought no special goodness could be lost if he fulfilled at last his summer wish and saw them picked unbruised and in a chsh where they could ripen safely to the eatmg but when he came to look no apples there under or on the tree or anywhere and the hghtnatured tree seemed not to

hale took off his sunday hat and ceremoniously laid it on the ground and leaping on it with a solemn bound danced slowly on it till he trod it hat then suddenly he saw the thing he did and looked around to see if he was seen this was the sin that ahaz was forbid the meaning of the passage had been hid to look upon the tree when it was green and worship apples what else could it mean god saw him dancing in the orchard path but mercifully kept the passing crowd from witnessing the fault of one so proud and so the story wasnt told in gath in gratitude for which square matthew vowed to walk

must have measured to the further wall but we who passed were not to see him fall the miles and miles he lived from anywhere were evidently somethmg he could bear he stood unshaken and if grim and gaunt it was not necessarily from want he had the oaks for heating and for light he had a hen he had a pig in sight he had a well he had the rain to catch he had a tenbytwenty garden patch nor did he

without the needed insight they bit the glass and listened for the flavor they broke the handle and the binding off it then none the wiser frankly gave it up and having bid it in their bedding straw

nght thing to its root it never will show much flower or fruit but i may be one who does not care ever to have tree bloom or bear leaves for smooth and bark for rough leaves and bark may be tree

strength and been too fierce from fear i have safely trodden underfoot the leaves of another year all summer long they were overhead more lifted up than i to come to their final place in earth they had to pass me by all summer long i thought i heard them threatenmg under their breath and when they came it seemed with a will to carry me with them to death they spoke to the fugitive in my heart as if it were leaf to leaf they tapped at my eyelids and touched my lips with an in vitation to grief but it was no reason i had to go because they had to go now up my knee to keep on top of another year

apples or something forgotten and left so smelling their sweetness would be no theft j   there are roughly zones we sit indoors and talk of the cold outside and every gust that gathers strength and

have brought the peach what comes over a man is it soul or mind that to no limits and bounds he can stay confined you would say his ambition was to extend the reach clear to the arctic of every hying kind why is his nature forever so hard to teach that though there is no fixed line between wrong and right there are roughly zones whose laws must be obeyed there is nothing much we can do for the tree tonight but we cant help feeling more than a little betrayed that the northwest wind should rise to such a height just when the cold went down so many below the tree has no leaves and may never have them again ve must wait till some months hence in the spring to mow but if it is destined never again to grow it can blame this limitless trait in the hearts of men    a trial run i said to

your least touch sets it going round and when to stop it rests with you    not quite social some of you will be glad i did what i did and the rest wont want to punish me too severely for finding a

outlands   the vindictives you hke to hear about gold a kmg filled his pnson room as full as the room could hold to the top of his reach on the wall with every known shape of the stuff twas to buy lnmself off his doom but it wasnt ransom enough his captors accepted it all but didnt let go of the king they made him send out a call to his subjects to gather them more and his subjects wrung all they could wring out of temple and palace and store but when there seemed no more to bring his captors convicted the long of once having started a war and strangled the wretch with a string but really that gold was not half that a king might have hoped to compel not a half not a third not a tithe the king had scarce ceased to writhe when hate gave a terrible laugh like a manhole opened to hell if gold pleased the conqueror well that gold should be the one thing the conqueror henceforth should lack they gave no more thought to the king all joined in the game of rudegold they swore all the gold should go back deep into the earth whence it came    their minds ran on cranny and crack all joined in the maddening game the tale is still boastingly told of many a treasuie by name that vanished into the black and put out its light for the foe that selfsack and selfoverthrow that was the splendidest sack since the forest germans sacked rome and took the gold candlesticks home one inca prince on the rack and late in his last hour alive told them in what lake to dive to seek what they seemed so to want they dived and nothing was found he told them to dive till they drowned the whole fierce conquering pack hunted and tortured and raged there were suns of story and vaunt they searched for into brazil their tongues hanging out unassuaged but the conquered grew meek and stul they slowly and silently aged they kept their secrets and died mahciously satisfied one knew of a burial hole in the hoor of a tribal cave where under deep ash and charcoal and cracked bones human and beast the

inleaning under the strain and looped ten times back and forth had served as a palace gate some said it had gone to the coast some over the mountains east some into the country north on the backs of a singlefile host commanded by one sunpriest and raising a dust with a tram of hashing hnks in the sun no matter what some may say the saying is never done there bright in the filth it lay untarnished by rust and decay and be all plunderers curst cthe best way to hate is the worst tis to find what the hated need never mind of what actual worth and wipe that out of the earth let them die of unsatisfied greed of unsatisfied love of display of unsatisfied love of the high unvulgar unsoiled and ideal let their trappings be taken away let them suffer starvation and die of being brought down to the real     the bearer of evil tidings the bearer of evu tidings when he was halfway there rclnembered that evil tidings were a dangerous thing to bear so when he came to the parting where one road led to the throne and one went off to the mountains and into the wild unknown he took the one to the mountains he ran through the vale of cashmere he ran through the rhododendrons till he came to the land of pamir and there in a precipice valley a girl of his age he met took him home to her bower or he might be running yet she taught him her tribes religion how ages and ages since a princess en route from china to marry a persian prince had been found with child and her army had come to a troubled halt and though a god was the father and nobody else at fault it had seemed discreet to remain there and neither go on nor back so they stayed and declared a village there in the land of the yak    and the child that came of the pnncess estabhshed a royal line and lus mandates were given heed to because he was born divine and that was why there were people on one himalayan shelf and the bearer of evil tidmgs decided to stay there himself at least he had this ill common with the race he chose to adopt they had both of them had their reasons for stopping where they had stopped as for his evil tidings belshazzars overthrow why hurry to tell belshazzar what soon enough he would know    iris by night one misty evening one anothers guide we two were groping down a malvern side the last wet fields and dnpping hedges home there came a moment of confusmg lights such as accordlng to behef in rome were seen of old at memphis on the heights before the fragments of a fonner sun could concentrate anew and rise as one light was a paste of pigment in our eyes and then there was a moon and then a scene so watery as to seem submanne in which we two stood saturated drownea the clovermingled rowan on the ground had taken all the water it could as dew and still the air was saturated too its airy pressure turned to water weight then a small rainbow like a trelhs gate a very small moonmade prismatic bow stood closely over us through which to go and then we were vouchsafed the miracle that never yet to other two befell and i alone of us have lived to tell a wonderl bow and rainbow as it bent instead of moving with us as we went to keep the pots of gold from being found it hfted from its dewy pediment its two moteswimming manycolored ends and gathered them together in a ring and we stood in it softly circled round from all division time or foe can bring in a relation of elected friends    build soil   build soila political pastoral why tityrus but youve forgotten me im mehboeus the potato man the one you had the talk with you remember here on tills very campus years ago hard brnes have struck me and im on the move ive had to give my interval fann up for interest and rve bought a mountain farm for nothing down allautdoors of a place all woods and pasture only fit for sheep but sheep is what im going mto next im done forever with potato crops at thrrty cents a bushel grve me sheep i know wools down to seven cents a pound but i dont calculate to sell my wool i didnt my potatoes i consumed them rll dress up in sheeps clothing and eat sheep the muse takes care of yuu you live by wnting your poems on a farm and call that farming oh i dont blame you i say take life easy i should myself only i dont know how but have some pity on us who have to work why dont you use your talents as a writer to advertise our farms to city buyers or else write something to improve food prices get in a poem toward the next election oh meliboeus i have half a mind to take a writing hand in politics before now poetry has taken notice of wars and what are wars but politics transformed from chronic to acute and bloody    i may be wrong but tityrus to me the times seem revolutionary bad the question is whether theyve reached a depth of desperation that would warrant poetrys leaving loves alternations joy and grief the weathers alternations summer and winter our agelong theme for the uncertainty of judging who is a contemporary liar who in particular when all alike get called as much in clashes of ambition life may be tragically bad and i make bold to sing it so but do i dare name names and tell you who by name is wicked whittiers luck with skipper ireson awes me many mens luck with greatest washington who sat for stuarfs portrait but who sat equally for the nations constitution i prefer to smg safely in the realm of types composite and imagined people to affinn there is such a thing as evil personified but ask to be excused from saying on a jury heres the guilty i doubt if youre convinced the times are bad i keep my eye on congress meliboeus theyre in the best position of us all to know if anything is very wrong i mean they could be trusted to give the alann if earth were thought about to change its axis or a star coming to dilate the sun as long as lightly all their livelong sessions like a yard full of school boys out at recess    before their plays and games were organized they yelling mix tag hideandseek hopccotch and leap frog in each others wavalrs ell let newspapers profess to fear the worst notlungs portentous i am reassured is socialism needed do you thmk we have it now for sociahsm is an element m any government theres no such thmg as sociahsm pure except as an abstraction of the mmd theres only democratic socialism monarchic soclalismohgarchic the last bemg what they seem to have in russia you often get it most in monarchy least in democracy in practice pure i dont know what it would be no one knows i have no doubt like all the loves when philosophized together rota one one sickness of the body and the soul thank god our practice holds the loves apart beyond embarrassing selfconsciousness where natural fnends are met where dogs are kept where women pray with priests there is no love theres only love of men and women love of children love of fnends of men of god divine love human love parental love roughly discriminated for the rough poetry itself once more is back in love pardon the analogy my meliboeus for sweeping me away lets see where was i    but dont you thmk more should be sociahzed than is what should you mean by sociahzed made good for everyonethmgs like inventlons made so we all should get the good of them all not just great exploiting businesses we sometimes only get the bad of them in your sense of the word ambition has been socializedthe first propensity to be attempted greed may well come next but the worst one of all to leave uncurbed unsociahzed is ingenuity which for no sordid selfaggrandizement for nothing but its own blind satisfaction in this it is as much like hate as love works in the dark as much against as for us even while we talk some chemist at columbia is stealthlly contriving wool from jute that when let loose upon the grazing world will put ten thousand farmers out of sheep everyone asks for freedom for himself the man free love the business man free trade the writer and talker free speech and free press political ambition has been taught by being punished back it is not free it must at some point gracefully refrain greed has been taught a little abnegation and shall be more before were done with it it is just fool enough to think itself selftaught but our brute snarling and lashing taught it none shall be as ambitious as he can      none should be as ingenious as he could not if i had my say bounds should be set to ingenuity for being so cruel in bringing change unheralded on the unready i elect you to put the curb on it were i dictator ill tell you what id do what should you do id let things take their course and then rd claim the credit for the outcome youd make a sort of safetyfirst dictator dont let the things i say against myself betray you into taking sides against me or it might get you into trouble with me im not afraid to prophesy the future and be judged by the outcome meliboeus listen and i will take my dearest risk were always too much out or too much in at present from a cosmical dilation were so much out that the odds are against our ever getting inside in again but inside in is where weve got to get my friends all know im interpersonal but long before im interpersonal away way down inside im personal just so before were international were national and act as nationals the colors are kept unmixed on the palette or better on dish plates all around the room    so the effect when they are mixed  canvas jay seem almost exclusively designed some minds are so confounded intennental they remmd me of pictuies on a palette look at what happened surely some god pmxlt come look at my signlficant mud pie its hard to tell which is the worse abhorrence whether ifs persons pled or nations pied dont let me seem to say the exchange the encounter may not be the important thing at last it well may be we meeti dont say when but must bring to the meeting the maturest the longestsavedup raciest localest we have strength of reserve in us to bnng tityrus sometimes rm perplexed myself to find the good of commerce why should i have to sell you my apples and buy yours it cant be just to give the robber a cl lnce to catch them and take toll of them ill translt too mean a thought to get much comfort out of i figure that like any bandying of words or toys it ministers to health it very likely quickens and refines us to market tis our destiny to go but much as in the end we bring for sale there there is still more we never bring or should bring more that should be kept backthe soil for instance in my opinionthough we both know poets who fall all over each other to bring soil and even subsoil and hardpan to market to sell the hay off let alone the soil    is an unpardonable sin in farming the moral is make a late stalt to nlalket let me preach to you will you ehboeus preach on i thought you were already preachmg but preach and see if i can tell the difference needless to say to you my argument is not to lure the city to the country let those possess the land and only those who love it with a love so strong and stupid that they may be abused and taken advantage of and made fun of by busmess law and art they still hang on that so much of the earths unoccupied need not make us uneasy we dont pretend to complete occupancy the worlds one globe human society another softer globe that slightly flattened rests on the world and clinging slowly rolls we have our own round shape to keep unbroken the worlds size has no more to do with lls than has the universes we are balls we are round from the same source of roundness we are both round because the mind is round because all reasoning is in a circle at least thats why the universe is round if what youre preaching is a line of conduct just what am i supposed to do about it reason in circles no refuse to be seduced back to the land by any claim the land may seem to have on man to use it    let none assume to till the land but farmers i only speak to you as one of them you shall go to your runout mountain farm poor castaway of commerce and so live that none shall ever see you come to market not for a long long time plant breed produce but what you raise or grow why feed it out eat it or plow it under where it stands to build the soil for what is more accursed than an impoverished soil pale and metallic what cries more to our kind for sympathy ill make a compact with you meliboeus to match you deed for deed and plan for plan friends crowd around me with their fiveyear plans that soviet russia has made fashionable you come to me and ill unfold to you a fiveyear plan i call so not because it takes ten years or so to carry out rather because it took five years at least to think it out come close let us conspire in selfrestraint if in restraint of trade you will go to your runout mountain farm and do what i command you i take care to command only what you meant to do anyway that is my style of dictator build soil turn the farm in upon itself unti it can contain itself no more but sweatingfull drips wine and oil a little r will go to my runout social mind and be as unsocial with it as i can the thought i have and my first impulse is to take to marketi will turn it under the thought from that thoughti will tum it under    and so on to the hmit of my nature we are too much out and if ve wont draw in we shall be dnven in i was brought up a statenghts freetrade democrat vvhats that an inconsistency the state shall be laws to itself it seems and yet have no control of what it sells or what it buys suppose someone comes near me who in rate of speech and thinking is so much my better i am imposed on silenced and discouraged do i submit to being supplied by him as the more economical producer more wondenul more beautiful producer no i unostentatiously move off far enough for my thoughtflow to resume thought product and food product are to me nothing compared to the producing of them i sent you once a song with the refrain let me be the one to do what is done my share at least lest i be emptyidle keep off each other and keep each other off you see the beauty of my proposal is it neednt wait on general revolution i bid you to a oneman revolution the only revolution that is coming were too unseparate out among each other with goods to sell and notions to impart a youngster comes to me with half a quatrain to ask me if i think it worth the pains of working out the rest the other half i am brought guaranteed young prattle poems    made publicly in school above suspicion of plagiarism and help of cheating parents we congregate embraclng from distrust as much as love and too close in to strike and be so very striking steal away the song says steal away and stay away dont jom too many gangs join few if any jom the united states and jom the famuy but not much in between unless a college is it a bargain shepherd mehboeus probably but youre far too fast and strong for my mind to keep worlang in your presence i can tell better after i get home better a month from now when cutting posts or mending fence it all comes back to me what i was thinking when you interrupted my lifetrain logic i agree with you were too unseparate and going home from company means coming to our senses j   to a thinker the last step taken found your heft decidedly upon the left one more would throw you all the nght another stiliyou see your plight you call this trunkmg but its wallong not even that its only rocking or weaving like a stabled horse from force to matter and back to force from form to content and back to form from norm to crazy and back to norm from bound to free and back to bound from sound to sense and back to sound so back and forth it almost scares a man the way things come in pairs just now youre off democracy with a pohte regret to be and leaning on dictatorship but if you will accept the tip in less than no bme tongue and pen youll be a democrat agam a reasoner and good as such dont let it bother you too much if it makes you look helpless please and a temptation to the tease suppose youve no direction in you i dont see but you must continue to use the gift you do possess and sway with reason more or less i own i never really warmed to the reformer or reformed    and yet conversion has its place not halfway down the scale of grace so if you find you must repent from side to side in argument at least dont use your mind too hard but trust

eve had added to their own an oversound her tone of meaning but without the words admittedly an eloquence so soft could only have had an influence on birds when call or laughter carried it aloft be that as may be she was in their song moreover her voice upon their voices crossed had now persisted in the woods so long that probably it never would be lost never again would birds song be the same and to do that to birds was why she came    the subverted flower she drew back he was calm cit is this that had the power and he lashed rus open palm with the tenderheaded hower he smiled for her to smile but she was either blind or willfully unkind he eyed her for a while for a woman and a puzzle he flicked and hung the flower and another sort of smile caught up like finger tips the comers of lus lips and cracked his ragged muzzle she was standing to the waist in goldenrod and brake her shining hair displaced he stretched her either arm as if she made it ache to clasp hernot to hann as if he could not spare to touch her neck and hair clf this has come to us and not to me alone so she thought she heard him say though with every word he spoke his lips were sucked and blown and the effort made him choke like a tiger at a bone she had to lean away she dared not stir a foot    lest movement should provoke the demon of pursuit that slumbers in a brute it was then her inothers call from inside the garden wall made her steal a look of fear to see if he could hear and would pounce to end it all before her mother came she looked and saw th shame a hand hung hke a paw an arm worked like a saw as if to be persuasive an ingratiating laugh that cut the snout in half an eye become evasive a girl could only see that a hower had marred a man but what she could not see was that thd hower might be other than base and fetid that the hower had done but part and what the hower began her own too meager heart had terribly completed she looked and saw the worst and the dog or what it was obeying bestial laws a coward save at night turned from the place and ran she heard him stumble first and use his hands in flight she heard him bark outright    and oh for one so young the bitter words she spit like some tenacious bit that will not leave the tongue she plucked her lips for it and still the horror clung her mother wiped the foain from her chin picked up her comb and drew her backward home    willful homing it is getting dark and time he drew to a house but the blizzard blinds him to any house ahead the storm gets down his neck in an icy souse that sucks his breath hke a

cloud shadow a breeze discovered nly open book and began to hutter the leaves to look for a poem there used to be on spnng i tried to tell her theres no such thingl for whom would a poem on spring be by the breeze disdained to make reply and a cloud shadow crossed her face for fear i would make her miss the place    the quest of the purplefringed i felt the dull of the meadow underfoot but the sun overhead and snatches of verse and song of scenes hke this i sung or said i sknted the margin alders for miles and miles in a sweeping line the day was the day by every flower that blooms but i saw no sign yet further i went to be before the scythe for the grass was high till i saw the path where the slender fox had come and gone panting by then at last and followmg him i found in the very hour vhen the color flushed to the petals it must have been the farsought flower there stood the purple spires with no breath of air nor headlong bee to disturb their perfect poise the hvelong day neath the alder tree i only melt and putting the boughs aside looked or at most counted them all to the buds in the copses depth that were pale as a ghost    then i arose and silently wandered home and i

lord or from her own self against her will was not set forth in the lading hill a stolen lady was all it said she came down weakly and blindly led to the darkening windy village slip she would not look at the fateful ship her lover to make the ordeal swift had to give her the final lift and force her farewell step off shore the way she clung to him the more seemed to argue perhaps she went not entirely without consent but with no companion of womankind to leave the english law behind and sail for some vague paphian bourn began already to seem forlorn it did more distance up and down their little stormy ship than on now it took a fitful run now standing cracked its sail and spun now stood upon its bulging prow till the pirate sailors made a vow of where they would go on pilgrimage if god would spare them to die of age when the clap of two converging waves failed to crush their barrel staves    or the wind to snap their walking stick they laughed as if they had turned a trick this was no ladys time of year for long the lady would disappear and might be rolling dead below for all the crew were let to know but when the oceans worst had passed she was carried out beside the mast where all day long she lay and dozed or she and her lover would sit opposed and darkly drink each others eyes with faint head shakings no more wise the most he asked her eyes to grant was that in what she does not want a woman wants to be overruled or was the instinct in him fooled he knew not neither of them knew they could only say like any two you tell me and fn tell youl sometimes with her permissive smile he left her to her thoughts awhile and went to lean against the rail and let the captain tell rum a tale he had to keep the captains favor the ship it seemed had been a slaver and once they had shipped a captive pair whose love was such they didnt care who took in them onlookers share well when at length the fever struck that spoils the niggertraders luck the man was among the first it took    throw him over ahve they said before the thing has time to spread youve got to keep the quarters clean but the girl fought them and made a scene she was a savage jungle cat it was easy to be angry at which put the thought into someones head of the ocean bed for a marriage bed some tom said to dick or harry apparently these two ought to marry we get plenty funerals at sea how for a change would a wedding be or a combmahon of the two how would a funeralwedding do its gone so far shes probably caught whatever it is the niggers got they bound them naked so they faced with a length of cordage about the waist many lovers have been divorced by having what is free enforced but presence of love these had in death to kiss and drink each others breath before they were hurled from the slavers deck they added clasps about the neck and went embraced to the cold and dark to be their own marriage feast for the shark when after talk with other men a man comes back to a woman again he tells her as much of blood and dirt as he thinks will do her not too much hurt what was the pirate captains chaff he laughed but he did not make you laugh    the jest seemed his and the plaudits his  heard him shout vhat a thing it is some standing jest between you men dont tell me if you dont want to then whereat in a moment of closs unruth he thought all right if ou want the truth i dont believe it it isnt true it never happened did it you seeing no help ill wings or feet she withdrew back ill selfretreat till her heart almost ceased to beat her spint faded as far away as the living ever go yet stay and her thought was she had had her pay he said to the captain give command and bring us to the nearest land and let us try an untossed place and see if it will help her case they brought her to a nameless isle and the ship lay in the bay for a while waibng to see if she would mend but sailed and left them in the end her lover saw them sail away but dared not tell her all one day for slowly even her sense of him and love itself were growing dim he no more drew the smile he sought the story is she dted of thought and when her lover was left alone he stayed long enough to carve on stone the name of the lady with his own to be her only marriage lines    and carved them round with a scloli of vines then he gouged a clumsy sailmg trough from a fallen tree and pushing off safely made the african shore where he fell a prisoner to the moor but the moor strangely enough believed the tale of the voyage he had achieved and sent him to the king to admire he came at last to his native shire the island he found was verified and the bay where his stolen lady died was named for him mstead of her but so is history like to err and soon it is neither here nor there whether times rewards are fair or unfair    two or more   the gift outright the land was ours before we were the lands she was our land more than a hundred years before we were her people she was ours in massachusetts in virginia but we were englands still colonials possessing what we still were unpossessed by possessed by what we now no more possessed something we were withholding made us weak unhl we found out that it was ourselves we were withholding from our land of hving and forthwith found salvation in surrender such as we were we gave ourselves outright the deed of gut was many deeds of war to the land vaguely realizing westward but shll unstoned artless unenhanced such as she was such as she would become    triple bronze the infinites being so wide is the reason the powers provide for inner defense my hide for next defense outside i make myself this time of wood or granite or hme a wall too hard for crime either to breach or climb then a number of us agree on a national boundary and that defense makes three between too much and me    our hold on the planet we asked for raln it didnt hash and roar it didnt lose its temper at our demand and blow a gale it didnt misunderstand and give us more than our spokesman bargamed for and just because we owned to a wish for rain send us a hood and bid us be damned and drown it gently threw us a ghttenng shower down and when we had taken that into the roots of gram it threw us another and then another still till the spongy soil again was natal wet we may doubt the just proportion of good to ill there is much in nature against us but we forget take nature altogether since time began including human nature in peace and war and it must be a httle more in favor of man say a fraction of one per cent at the very least or our number living wouldnt be steadily more our hold on the planet wouldnt have so mcreased    to a young wretch boethian as gay for you to take your fathers ax as take his gunrodto go huntingfishing you nick my spruce until its fiber cracks it gives up standing straight and goes down swislung you link an arm in its arm and you lean across the hght snow homeward smelling green i could have bought you just as good a tree to frizzle resin in a candle flame and what a saving twould have meant to me but tree by charity is not the same as tree by enterprise and expedition i must not spoil your christmas with contrition it is your christmases against my woods but even where thus opposing interests kill they are to be thought of as opposing goods oftener than as conflictmg good and ill which makes the war god seem no special dunce for always fighting on both sides at once and though in tinsel chain and popcorn rope my tree a captive in your window bay has lost its footing on my mountain slope and lost the stars of heaven may oh may the symbol star it lifts against your ceiling help me accept its fate with christmas feeling    the lesson for today if this uncertain age in which we dwell lvvere really as dark as i hear sages tell and i convinced that they were really sages i should not curse myself with it to hell but leaving not the chair i long have sat in i should betake me back ten thousand pages to the worlds undebatably dark ages and getting up my medieval latin seek converse common cause and brotherhood by all thats liberali should i should with poets who could calmly take the fate of being born at once too early and late and for these reasons kept from bemg great yet singing but dione in the wood and ver aspergit terram floribus they slowly led old latin verse to rhyme and to forget the ancient lengths of time and so began the modern world for us id say  master of the palace school you were not charles nor anybodys fool tell me as pedagogue to pedagogue you did not know that smce king charles did rule you had no chance but to be mmor did you your light was spent perhaps as in a fog that at once kept you burning low and hid you the age may very well have been to blame for your not having won to virgils fame but no one ever heard you nlake the claim you would not thmk you knew enough to judge the age when full upon you thats my pomt    we have today and i could call their name who know exactly what is out of joint to make their verse and their excuses lame theyve tried to grasp with too much social fact too large a situation you and i would be afraid if we should comprehend and get outside of too much bad statistics our muscles never could again contract we never could recover human shape but must live lives out mentally agape or die of philosophical distention thats how we feeland were no special mystics we cant appraise the time in which we act but for the folly of it lefs pretend we know enough to know it for adverse one more millenniums about to end lefs celebrate the event my distanl friend in pubhcly disputing which is worse the present age or your age you and i as schoolmen of repute should qualify to wage a fine scholastical contention as to whose age deserves the lower mark or should i say the higher one for dark i can just hear the way you make it go theres always somethmg to be sorry for a sordid peace or an outrageous war yes yes of course we have the same convention the groundwork of all faith is human woe it was well worth preliminary mention theres nothing but injustice to be had no choice is left a poet you might add but how to take the curse tragic or comic    it was well worth preliminary mentlon but lees go on to where our cases part if part they do let me propose a start were rivals in the badness of our case remember and must keep a solemn face space ails us moderns we are sick with space its contemplation makes us out as small as a brief epidemic of microbes that in a good glass may be seen to crawl the patina of this the least of globes but have we there the advantage after all you were belittled into vilest wonns god hardly tolerated with his feet which comes to the same thing in different terms we both are the belittled human race one as compared with god and one with space i had thought ours the more profound disgrace but doubtless this was only my conceit the cloister and the observatory saint take comfort in about the same complaint so science and religion really meet i can just hear you call your palace class come learn the latin eheu for alas you may not want to use it and you may o paladins the lesson for today is how to be unhappy yet polite and at the summons roland olivier and every sheepish paladin and peer being already more than proved in fight sits

rehgion love the somber chord earths a hard place in which to save the soul and could it be brought under state control so automatically we all were saved its separateness from heaven could be waived it might as well at once be langdomcome perhaps it will be next millennium but these are universals not confined to anyone trrne place or human land were either nothmg or a gods regret as ever when philosophers are met no matter where they stoutly mean to get nor what particulars they reason froln they are philosophers and from old habit they end up in the universal whole as unoriginal as any rabbit one age is like another for the soul im telling you you havent said a thing unless i put it in your mouth to say im having the whole argument my way but in your favorplease to tell your king in having granted you all ages shine yuh equal darkness yours as dark as mine im liberal you you aristocrat vont know exactly what i mean by that i mean so altruistically moral i never take my own side in a quarrel    id lay my hand on his hand on his staff lean back and have my confidenhallaugh and tell m i had read his epitaph it sent me to the graves the other day the only other there was far away across the landscape with a watering pot at his devotions ill a special plot and he was there resuscitating flowers make no mistake about its being bones but i was only there to read the stones to see what on the whole they had to say about how long a man may think to live which is becoming my concern of late and very wide the choice they seemed to grve the ages ranging all the way from hours to months and years and many many years one man had lived one hundred years and eight but though we all may be inclmed to wait and follow some development of state or see what comes of science and mvenhon there is a limit to our time extension we all are doomed to brokenoff careers and sos the nation sos the total race the earth itself is liable to the fate of meaninglessly bemg broken off and hence so many literary tears at which my inclination is to scoff i may have wept that any should have died or missed their chance or not have been their best or been their riches fame or love denied on me as much as any is the jest    i take my incompleteness with the rest god bless hlmseh can no one else be blessed i hold your doctrine of memento mori and were an epitaph to be my story rd

i bum but say with what degree of heat talk fahrenheit talk centigrade use language we can comprehend tell us what elements you blend it gives us strangely little aid but does tell something in the end and steadfast as keats eremite not even stooping from its sphere it asks a little of us here it asks of us a certain height so when at times the mob is swayed to carry praise or blame too far we may take something like a star to stay our minds on and be staid    closed for good much as i own lowe the passels of the past because their to and fro has cut this road to last lowe them more today because theyve gone away and come not back with steed and chariot to chide my slowness with their speed and scare me to one side they have found other scenes for haste and other nleans they leave the road to me to walk ill saying naught perhaps but to a bee inaudibly in thought from you the road receives a priming coat of leaves and soon for lack of sun the prospects are in white it will be further done but with a coat so hght the shape of leaves will show beneath the brush of snow and so on into winter till even i have ceased to come as a foot printer    and only some slight beast so mousy or so foxy shall pnnt thele as my proxy    from plane to plane neither of them was better than the other they both were hued and though pike had the advantage of having hoed and mowed for fifty years dick had of being fresh and full of college so if they fought about equality it was on an equality they fought your trouble is not sticking to the subject pike said with temper and dick longed to say your trouble is bucolic lack of logic but all he did say was what is the subject its whether these professions really work now take the doctor they were giving com a final going over with the hoe before they turned from everytrung to hay the wavy upflung pennons of the corn were loose all round their legsyou couldnt say how many thousand of them in an acre every time dick or pike looked up the doctor with one foot on the dashboard of his buggy was still ill sight like someone to depend on nowhere but on the bradford interval by the connecticut could anyone have stayed in sight so long as an example taking his own sweet time as if to show he dont mmd havmg lost a case pike said and when he caught dick looking once too often hoeings too much like work for dick he added    dick wishes he could swap jobs with the doctor lets holler and ask him if he wont prescnbe for all humanity a complete rest from all this wagery but whafs the use of asking any sympathy of him that class of people dont know what work is more than they know what courage is that clann the moral kinds as brave as facing bullets dick told him to be fairer to the doctor he looks to me hke going home successful full of success with that foot on the dashboard as a small selfconferred reward of virtue i get you when you hoe out to the river then pick your hoe up maybe shoulder it and take your walk of recreation back to curry favor with the dirt some more isnt it pretty much the same idea you said yourself you werent avoiding work youd bet you got more work done m a day or at least in a hfetime by that method i wouldnt hoe both ways for anybody and right you are you do the way we do in reading dont you btllat every line end pick up our eyes and carry them back idle across the page to where we started from the other way of readmg back and forth known as boustrophedon was found too awkward pike grunted rather grimly with misgiving at being thus expounded to himself    and made of by a boy then having reached the river bank quit work defiantly as if he didnt care who understood him and started his march back again discoursing a man has got to keep his extrication the important thing is not to get bogged down in what he has to do to earn a livmg whats more i hate to keep afflicting weeds i like to give my enemies a truce be careful how you use your influence if i decided to become a doctor youd be to blame for furnishing the reasons i thought you meant to be an indian chief you said the second coming of tecumseh remember how you envied general sherman william tecumseh sherman why tecumseh he tried to imitate dicks tone of voice you wished your middle name had been tecumseh i think ill change my mind youre saying that to bother me by siding with the doctor youve got no social conscience as they say or youd feel differently about the classes you cant claim yodre a social visionary  im saying it to argue his idea s the same as your idea only more so and i suspect it may be more and more so the further up the scale of work you go    you could do worse than boost me up to see it isnt just the same and some day schoolboy ill show you why it isntnot today today i want to talk about the sun mayas expected was a dlsappomtment and june was not much better cold and rainy the sun then had his longest day in heaven but no one from the feehng would have guessed his presence was particularly there he only stayed to set the summer on fire then fled for fear of getting stuck in lava in case the rocks should melt and run again everyone has to keep his extncation thats what the doctors doing keeping his thats what i have to do in school keep mine from knowing more than i know how to think with you see it in youiself and in the sun yet you refuse to see it in the doctor all nght lets harmonize about the doctor he may be some good in a manner of speaking i own he does look busy when the sun is in the sign of sickness in the winter and everybodys being sick for christmas thens when his morgan lights out throwing snowballs behind her at the dashboard of his pung but cygnus isnt in the zodiac dick longed to say but wasnt sure enough of his astronomy hed have to take a half course in it next year and besides why give the controversy a relapse    they weie both bent on scuffhng up alluvium so pure that when a blade to therr surprise rang once on stone all day each tried to be the first at getting in a superstitious cry for farmers luck a rivalry that made them both feel lander and so to let pike seem to have the palm with grace and not too formal a surrender dick said cyouve been a lesson in walk wisdom to work with bill but you wont have ily thanks i like to think the suns like you in that since you bring up the subject of the sun this would be my interpretation of him he bestows summer on us and escapes before our realizing what we have to thank him for he doesnt want a u f thanks he likes to tum his back on gratitude and avoid being worshiped as a god our worship was a thing he had too much of in the old days in persia and peru shall i go on or have i said enough to convey my respect for your posltion ci guess so pike said innocent of milton thats where i reckon santa claus comes in to be our parents pseudonymity in christmas giving so they can escape the thanks and let him catch it as a scapegoat and even he youll notice dodges off up chimney to avoid the worst of it we all know his address mount hecla iceland so anyone can write to him who has to    though they do say he doesnt open letters a santa claus was needed and there is one so i have heard and do in palt believe it dick said to old pike innocent of shakespeare   a masque of reason   all rights reserved caution plofeslonals and amateulli are hereby

worked up about it but she really hasnt not n the sense of having to my knowledge predicted anything that came to pass the witch of endor was a friend of mine you wouldnt say she fared so very badly i noticed when she called up samuel his spirit had to come apparently a witch was stronger than a prophet there but she was burned for witchcraft of record in my note book that is not well she was and i

showed i give you credit fol my forte is truth or metaphysics long the worlds leproach for standing still in one place b ue forever while science goes selfsupersemng on look at how far weve left the cultent science of genesis behind the wisdom there though is just as good as when i uttered it still novelty has doubtless an attraction so its important who first thinks of things im a great stickler for the authors name by proper names i find i do my thinking god who invented earth what still awake any originality it showed was of the devil he invented hell    job god job god false premises that are the original of all onginahty the sin that felled the angels wolsey should have said as for the earth we groped that out together much as your husband job and i together found out the discipline man needed most was to learn his submission to unreason and that for mans own sake as well as luine so he wont find it hard to take his orders from his inferiors in intelhgence in peace and warespecially in war so he wont find it hard to take ills war you have the idea theres not much i can tel you all very splendid i am flattered proud to have been in on anything with you twas a great demonstration if you say so though incidentally i sometimes wonder why it had had to be at my expense it had to be at somebodys expense society can never think things out it has to see them acted out by actors devoted actors at a sacnfice the ablest actors i can lay my hands on is that your answer no for i have yet to ask my question we disparage reason lob    but all the time its what were most concerned with theres will as motor and theles will as blakes reason is i suppose the steeling gem the will as brakes cant stop the will as motor for very long were plainly made to go were gomg anyway and may as well have some say as to where were headed for just as we will be talking anyway and may as well throw in a httle sense lets do so now because i let you off from telling me your reason dont assume i thought you had none somewhere back i knew you had one but this isnt it youre giving me you say we groped this out but if you will forgive me the irreverence it sounds to me as if you thought it out and took your time to it it seems to me an afterthought a long long afterthought id give more for one least beforehand reason than all the justuying expastfacto excuses trumped up by you for theologists the front of being answerable to no one im with you in maintaining to the public but lord we showed them what the audience has all gone home to bed the plays played out come after all these yearsto satisfy me im cunous and im a grownup man im not a child for you to put me off and tantahze me with another oh because youd be the last to want me to beheve all your effects were merely lucky blunders    that would be unbelief and atheism the artist in me cries out for design such devlhsh ingenuity of tortule did seem unhke you and i hied to think the reason might have been sonle other per sons but there is nothing you jre not behind i did not ask then but it seems as if now after all these years you might indulge me why did you hurt me so i am ieduced to asking flatly for the reasolloutnght god id tell you job lob all right dont tell me then if you dont want to i dont want to know but what is all this secrecy about i fail to see what fun what satisfaction a god can find in laughing at how badly men fumble at the possibilities when left to guess forever for themselves the chances are when theres so nluch pretense of metaphysical profundity the obscuritys a flaud to cover

blinging on is nothing but an outbreak of mass mercy too long pent up in ugorous conventlon a holy impulse towaids redistuhution to set out to homogenize mankind so that the cream could never rise again required someone who laughingly could play with the idea of justice in the courts could mock at riches in the light it claims to count on justice to be merely just but we are talking over jonahs head or clear off what we know his interests are still not so far off come to think of it there is some justice even as keeper says the thing that really counts though is the form of outrageviolencethat bleaks across it the very sleep we sleep is an example so that because were always starting fresh the best minds are the best at premises    keeper jonah and the most sacred thing

lights sicken crown the cellar door swings wide and slams again paul the fear that youre afraid with is the fear of gods decision lastly on your deeds that is the fear of god whereof tis wntten keeper but not the fear of punishment for sin  have to sin to prove it isnt that  uo inore governed by the fear of hell than by the fear of the asylum jail or poor houc the hasic three the state is founded on but  too inuch afraid of god to claim i have heen fighting on the angels side that is for him and not for me to say for me to say it would be irrehgious sometimes i think you are too sure you have heen and i can see that the uncertainty in which we act is a sevelity a cruelty amounting to injustice that nothing but gods mercy can assuage i can sec that if that is what you mean give me a hand up if we are agreed paul yes there you have it at the root of things we have to stay afraid deep in our souls our sacrifice the best we have to offer aud not our worst nor second best qur best    keeper

be found acceptable in heavens sight let the lost millions pray it in the darkf my failure is no diffelent from jonahs we both have lacked the coulage in the heart to overconle the fear within the soul and go ahead to any accoinphshnent courage is what it takes and takes the more of because the deeper fear is so eternal and if i say we lift hiin from the floor and lay him where you ordered hhn to lie before the cross it is froid fellow feehng as if i asked for one more chance ilyself to learn to say he moves to jonahs feet nothing can make injustice just but lnercy curtain
